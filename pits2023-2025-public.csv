Because of the Issues with personal safety and escalating stalking behaviors specifically towards this program instructor in the past (PITS incidents 19542 and PITS incident 19522), the nature of the phone calls have caused distress and alarm and appear to indicate that the individual is seeking to continue the harassing and stalking behaviors towards program instructor DV.
Subsequent calls from Trent Trout will be referred to a supervisor for a verbal warning. If harassment behavior persists or escalates, incident will be assessed for appropriate follow-up, to include suspension.
The numbers: The patron phone calls to VAL in the past 6 weeks were more frequent than from any other person, reports from staff who spoke to him, KG and XR indicated that the questions that he brought up seemed excessively invasive, specifically requesting personal schedule information, and specific locations to find program instructor DV during the week.

·They saw someone they described as a bald Hispanic person, taking photos of the children
·They told the school principle what they saw
·The school principle told them they would file a police report

Desk staff came to the back to ask Librarian Amy Williams for support.  I came to the front desk, listened to his side of the story, during which he called the policy stupid, along with using a few curse words.  I explained to him that while I understood his perspective and view of the policy, that we don't make these policies at the branch level.  I offered to extend the hold, so that he could come pick it up next week.  I also asked him if it would be at all possible for him to swing by the library after picking up his wife at the grocery store, so we could get their cards linked and so this wouldn't be an issue in the future.  Mr. Pasalis said this was unacceptable, he was tired, and he wasn't going to stop by the library again. He said that he was not leaving without his wife's book.  Mr. Pasalis' voice was raised to the point that another library patron stopped by the desk and asked him to lower his voice because he was being disruptive.  After further language and discussion with a raised voice, Mr. Pasalis eventually left.  After which, several patrons at the desk told library staff that they were sorry this happened, and one patron called over the phone to voice her concern about the situation.  The patron on the phone said she was worried the library user was going to ""come at"" the desk staff.

We've noticed him shaving in the van, suggesting he might be experiencing homelessness. He comes into the library once in a while to get water and use the restroom or the wi-fi, but otherwise doesn't engage much with staff. On Saturday, 1/14/23 a customer called saying that the man approached her and her young son in the parking lot and began talking about UFOs and bigfoot. She cut him off at one point and said she had to get going. She reported to staff that he seemed angry when she cut the conversation short. On the phone, LA TW told the woman that she was welcome to call the police if she wanted to, but he wasn't really breaking any of the library's rules. To our knowledge he hasn't been soliciting money at all. Through staff discussions, Librarian III BL learned that a few weeks ago, the man struck up a conversation with Librarian I CL about anti-masking that was slightly confrontational. On 1/18/23, Librarian-in-Charge CL noticed there were two Sheriff vehicles in the parking lot and they were talking to the man. When the man went back to his van, CL introduced himself as a staff person to the officers and asked if they could tell him what was going on. They didn't have much to say. When the man came back out from his van he said to CL, ""Are you the one who turned me in?"" We're assuming another patron called the police. Library staff did not. At this point the man tried to show the police what he was looking at on the computer. He seemed to want them to know he wasn't looking at porn.

MS continued to help him with copying and pasting onto word, until MS needed to speak with facilities, in which LA MD took over. 
After some time, LA MD and LTA JA were trying to print the patrons documents, when the patron randomly started talking about our LPI DV, and said, ""I use to be in her class, she is still here on Mondays right?"" LA MD scanned his card, and confirmed that this patron is the same patron from 000001552, and the same one who has made about 20 calls between ELP and Val asking for LPI DV's schedule and the computers classes that she teaches.  LA MD responded back to him, ""we don't know her schedule"" and then notified ML MS by using our code word that we set up for safety. ML MS called LSM PAC to notify her that Trent Trout is currently at ELP and that he asked about LPI DV. LSM PAC instructed ML MS to speak with the patron in person about his behavior. 
ML MS went to the patron and asked if she could speak with him and took him toward the front doors of the library. MS said, ""I just wanted to talk to you about some concerning behavior, about the multiple phone calls you have been doing. This behavior is the same type of behavior that you were suspended for back in 2019. This could lead to an order of harassment and then it could escalate."" He responded ""oh no I don't want that.""

He then replied, ""what if I have a question about the message?"", MS continued and said, ""then you can call back and ask only about the class."" He then thanked MS and went back to his computer.
 
After about 5 minuets, he asked to speak with ML MS again, when MS came out, the patron wanted to speak about the previous conversation and was agitated about it.

LA DB reviewed security cam footage from the past few days and made the following observations: a woman who has a large white dog and frequently parks her car in our lot (we presume she is living in her car at present) can be seen parking her car in our lot at 10:48pm on 1/19/23. Shortly after this (10:50pm), she appears to have let her dog out of the car to wander around for over an hour while she remained inside the car. The dog can be seen roaming around in all the areas where we later found doggy doo-doo. The footage is fairly blurry because of the dog's distance from the camera but it can be seen stopping and squatting at various times (good examples at 11:14pm, 11:32pm, 11:53pm). The dog is not visible after 11:57pm when it appears to have returned to the owner's car. The car departs the lot at 1:22am.
Further review of security camera footage shows no other dogs or large animals in the area for the previous several days; since it rained as recently as the 16th, and the doo-doo was visibly ""recent"" and did not seem to have been affected by any rainfall, I ended my review there. Based on these observations I think it is reasonable to conclude that this particular dog is responsible for the large amount of biowaste. Will consult with Branch Manager LG for next steps.

KS asked if he was returning it.  He said ""No. It is just the case. I already returned the DVD."". KS tried to ask if he had talked to another staff member or dropped the DVD off in the book chute... He interrupted her to ask about a movie. When KS tried to let him know, she ""would be happy to help with his request and still need more information about the DVD to make sure..."" He cut her off and made a comment ""I'm still talking - you know like Kamala Harris and all that...."" He started talking about a movie he wanted again. He repeatedly referred to the movie by an incorrect title and KS tried to ask him questions to figure out what movie he wanted, he appeared frustrated, complaining that ""we never have any of the classics"", and KS found the movie on Hoopla which he did not want.
With moment to speak, KS asked about the DVD case - if he had talked to someone about the DVD or just returned it to the bookchute, so she knew how to make sure I got it matched up and removed from his account. He replied that he already talked to a staff member over the phone, referring to him as the ""more melanated guy with the weird hair.""  KS did not respond immediately, and he launched into asking about another movie he wanted to check out.
He similarly did not have the correct title and was frustrated by describing it to KS. At one point, he mockingly said ""UMMMM, UMMM, UMMMM...Let's stop saying ""UMMM"" - we are getting no where"". Later, he asked LTA EH what his name was. EH told him his name and the patron repeated his name, pronouncing it incorrectly with a phrase and tried to engage him in conversation. EH turned away, and later indicated to KS that he ""felt like the patron was looking for an audience which he did not want to give him."" 
The Mr. Abadia returned later asking for help on the catalog to look up movies that ARE physical DVDs he can reserve.  KS showed him at the catalog computer behind the desk. He mentioned he had just come from a 12 Hour shift as a nurse. He asked for KS's name, noticing her badge. He made a point to thank her by name and say goodbye by name when he left. (KS felt repeating her name was done in a way that was unsettling and not friendly.)

Group B, which consisted of 4 older teens, kept moving between the library's 2nd floor and Jacome Plaza. Group A (Ashley, Jordan, Manny, Mohammed, and another teen) was alternately using the computers in the teen area and pressing up against the windows, making gestures at Group B when they were outside. Both groups were verbally challenging one another.
CS and Guard J arrived while Group B was outside. They let Group A know that fighting would not be tolerated in the library, and that if Group A didn't stop antagonizing Group B, then they would all have to leave. Group A said that if the other teens said something rude, they would say something back. CS told them that if they had a problem with another teen, they needed to talk to a staff member, and reiterated that fighting would not be permitted.
Group B returned to the teen space. Guard J and CS repeated the same rules to them. The groups sat on opposite ends of the teen space and did not speak to one another. Guard J and CS stayed in the area to keep things civil.
At 12:04, Group B went to the restroom. While inside, they began a water fight. Regular patron Tony entered the restroom as this was happening and asked the teens not to splash him. One teen pulled a gun out of his hoodie and asked if Tony wanted to fight. Tony told the teen to leave him alone. The teens left the restroom and returned to the 101 Space, where the teen with the gun covertly flashed his weapon to the teens in Group A. All four members of Group B walked quickly out of the library. They began picking rocks out of the planters and throwing them at the 101 Space windows, where Group A was once again taunting them and making rude gestures.
CS told Group A to stop instigating a fight, which is when group A told her that group B had threatened them with a gun. CS and Guard J went downstairs and met Officer Corrales, who called for backup. Police pursued the teens and apprehended all 4 involved at the library, plus 4 more, in the parking lot across from City High.
Group A was not asked to leave the library today, as they did not have any adults who could come pick them up, and staff were concerned about sending them out into Downtown while another group of potentially armed teens were upset with them. However, they will be suspended for a month.
Group B will be suspended for 1 year. All suspension letters should be delivered by a police officer if at all possible.

Around 1:20 p.m., Patron J begin to aggressively flip through the pages and start to ramble to himself.  The rambling became a bit loud. His rambling continued for about 2 minutes when LTA EH decided to approach Patron J and ask him if everything was okay. Patron J did not address LTA EH but in his rambling did clearly say, “It doesn’t matter cuz this is my last book anyway.” This is not an unusual way for patron J to signal to staff that he's getting ready to go, as he's had these types of interactions with most of the desk staff. Usually he is able to self-calm and bring the volume back down. LTA EH then decided to go back and continue shelving from the hold shelf cart.  
Minutes later, Patron J, while still rambling, finished flipping through the book and walked into the Men’s Restroom. While in the restroom, Patron J was rambling louder for about 3 to 5 minutes, it came across to LTA sup AK as shouting, and there was also some profanity. There were some loud banging noises coming from inside the Men’s Restroom alongside the ranting. LTA EH informed LTA Supervisor, AK, about the situation to ensure that others knew about it in case anyone decided to go towards the direction of the restrooms. 
A patron came out of the women's bathroom around 1:30 looking alarmed. She looked toward the desk and saw that staff was aware, and hurried out of the building. At about 1:35 p.m., Patron J came out of the Men’s Restroom, still rambling to himself and exited the library without incident. He did not appear to encounter anyone in the parking lot. Upon inspection there was nothing out of place or damaged in the men's restroom.

He left his belongings behind. Afterwards, he called Infoline and spoke to LA TW about his belongings, making threatening statements such as declaring that staff 'had better not touch anything'.
He returned to the library at 10am 2/15, still behaving in an extremely hostile manner. LA WB asked Librarian III AD to speak with him. During his conversation with AD, he did not make any overt threats but acted in an aggressive manner, demanding to know who had moved his belongings and where some missing slips of paper had gone. AD informed him that library staff had evacuated with the patrons and that when we returned, his bag was at the front desk, neatly labeled. They assured Mr. Harman that they would try to see where his papers had gone, but that it had been out of staff control and that they could not promise that the papers would be located. Staff checked the obvious spots -- around the front desk, the computer Mr. Harman had been using, and the lost and found -- to no avail. Mr. Harman demanded to know if library staff had had advance warning of the threat, and was told that it was a surprise to us as well. Mr. Harman calmed down a little at this and expressed his opinion that us not being informed was 'bullshit' and that it had happened because 'the cops are lazy and they want to do these drills here because you're right next door', but reiterated that 'someone still needs to find my notes'. AD again assured him that they would try, but could not promise.
Mr. Harman then moved off into the rest of the library. Approx. 12:15pm, he returned to the front desk, asking for the manager's email address to copy them on an email he was planning to send about the situation. AD provided their business card and he left the desk without further incident.

He directed staff to evacuate patrons from the side emergency exit and requested that we lock the front doors and keep patrons away from that area as that side of the building was closer to the package.
LIII AD proceeded to implement the emergency evacuation plans. LA WB and LTA Sup SG served as floor coordinators and other staff proceeded to the rally point. Once staff were safely gathered at the rally point, along with some patrons, Officer Parrish returned and directed staff to evacuate the parking lot, as well.

She was disappointed to learn that the courtesy phone would not make a long distance call. She said she had been a victim of identity theft and needed to make a long-distance call to get it sorted. She was upset when she was told she could not make a long-distance call from the courtesy phone. 
LA EP recommended she make a suggestion to allow the courtesy phone to make long-distance calls. LA EP called LIC DSL. 
DSL came and listened to the woman's complaint. The woman said she had been referred to the library by the City Manager's office, the police department, and her bank to the Main Library as a place she could make phone calls. She said none of them told her she could not call long distance. DSL said they probably weren't aware and that she would communicate with her supervisor that this was happening. 
The woman said she did not understand why she couldn't use the phone behind the desk. She said she had asked to use it before and had been given permission. DSL told her it was not a public phone and that it may have been a one-time thing, or it was before the courtesy phone was installed.
The woman said she had hired a lawyer to help her with identity theft and that it had been a long process to get it sorted. She said TPD wasn't helping her. DSL sympathized and said that sounded very difficult and frustrating. She asked if there were other places she could make long-distance calls, such as her lawyer's office or by purchasing a pre-paid phone. The woman said her lawyer lived in Phoenix and that she already had seven phones. 
DSL apologized and said she did not feel she could help her further. She told her she could make a suggestion in the box and escalate her complaint to Library Administration. DSL gave her the 5600 phone number. The woman became angrier and escalated her tone and volume and repeated herself several times. DSL said that she could not continue this conversation and that she had helped her as much as she could. The woman told DSL that she had not been helpful at all and that her tax dollars paid for the library, so she should be allowed to make long-distance calls. EP asked the woman to step aside so she could help other customers and the woman said that first she was going to finish her complaint.

Staff were not aware of the female filming in the building, who immediately went downstairs to the nonfiction area while the male approached the desk filming. LTA Supervisor LAM approached the customer and informed them that they could not film customers conducting their business in the library, but they could film staff or the building itself. LAM told the customer she had some information she would provide to them about this policy. LAM then went to the back staff area and informed Branch Manager LAF about the situation. LAF informed staff in the back room that there was a first amendment audit that was likely occurring on the floor and to stay in the back if they did not want to be filmed. LAF then went out to greet the customer, who was standing in front of the circulation desk and next to the children's area. LAF notified the customer that they were not permitted to film customers conducting their private library business in the building, but that they could film staff. LAM had given the customer a copy of A.R.S 41-151.22 before LAF greeted the customer and they were reviewing it. The customer asked many questions regarding A.R.S 41-151.22 and the code of conduct, claiming at one point that the revised statute was fake. They also stated that the code of conduct and the revised statute did not trump their rights. LAF asked many times for the customer to stop filming other customers, which they would not. This included families and small children. Customers were visibly distressed, some leaving the building, and one parent with their children in the children's area gathered her children and took them to an area in the stacks where they could not be seen. The incident was very disruptive to business as well as it took place in front of the circulation desk. LAF offered the customer options and told them they could stop filming and leave or they could choose to continue filming and that they would be suspended from the library and trespassed from the premises. The customer continued to film and LAF asked the customer to leave, which they did not, still filming, and said that they would finish filming the rest of the location and then leave. LAF informed them that if that was the course they chose and they refused to leave after they'd been asked to, LAF would need to call TPD. They continued filming and began to head deeper into the branch and LAF proceeded to the staff work area to call TPD. LAM remained at the desk. LAM informed LAF that the customer left while LAF was still on hold and in communications with TPD. TPD was informed the customers left the branch. LAM also informed LAF that a second person (the female customer) left filming with the customer who interacted with staff. The male customer has been identified by a name they use on youtube and potentially other social media, which is Joey Surreal. The female customer has not been identified.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0055",1,2023-03-01,0-01-01 13:00:00,"13:00:00","01:00:00 PM","Kirk-Bear Canyon",0-01-01 13:00:00,"13:00-13:59"

Branch Manager LAF answered the call and the person on the phone said their name was John. The person mentioned the filming on 3/1/23 and what occurred. They said the library is not within their rights to tell people they cannot film customers. They said that staff at Bear Canyon are interpreting the policy wrong. They personalized the issue to Bear Canyon staff multiple times. LAF told them this was a system-wide policy because they kept referencing our staff specifically and saying that staff at this location are interpreting the policy incorrectly. LAF thanked them for expressing their concerns and said that she would inform administration of the conversation. LAF also informed them that they could use the contact us feature on our website to express those concerns and that administration would see this. They continued on saying that they care about the library and that they were so glad we didn’t call the police because if the person filming had been arrested, that wouldn’t go well for the library and could have ended in civil litigation. In the film, the auditor asks staff member LTA Supervisor LAM if Branch Manager LAF was in the back calling the police and LAM answered, ""I don't know"". The customer continued on with the phone conversation and said they like the library and everything we do for the community and they “don’t want to see anything bad happen to us”. This was said two or three times in a pointed tone, which was vaguely threatening. They asked LAF who the policy came from and how that was being interpreted, and whether we have an attorney for the library or if it’s with the attorney for the county. LAF did not answer the question and directed them again to the website to express their concerns and assured them that she would share with administration what the customer said. They said good and said they were going to follow up on that. The phone call wrapped up here.

Believing that they were filming using their phones, LA MG notified Librarians KB and JD. KB and JD found Joey and the woman filming in the teen area. JD spoke to the woman, and KB spoke to the man. KB told Joey that he could film staff all he wanted but that it violated state law to film customers without consent. He told KB she didn't know what she was talking about and that he had been given this statute before but that it ""didn't apply to me, it applies to you."" He said it was a public building and no one should expect privacy. LIB JD engaged the woman in conversation, as the woman filmed books in the teen section. She told JD that she was at BCN and did not like the displays for children, specifically the Pride-related books. As KB and JD spoke with the two, they continued to walk toward the front entrance. KB asked Joey if they were going to leave because now they were not complying with a direct request and they were in violation of the Customer Code of Conduct. There was more talk about his rights and the fake law. JD then led the two out of the building, where they turned and filmed the hieroglyphics surrounding Wilmot's front entrance while JD gave them a history lesson about Wilmot.
Both returned about 15 minutes after leaving. The woman stayed in the lobby, while Joey came to the desk and asked to get a library card. JD said she would be perfectly happy to help if he put the camera down because there were customers around. He continued to film, scaring a young mother with kids away to hide in audiobook area.

The caller demanded to speak with the director. DB asked for clarification if the person meant the director of all Pima County Public Libraries or just the manager of the Salazar-Ajo Library. The caller proceeded to ask to speak to the director for the Ajo Library. DB identified herself as the managing librarian for the Ajo library. The caller started by announcing that there were lies being told about her (the caller) in the past and when she lived in Why before she didn't have any problems, but there were two staff members that were spreading lies about her and accusing her of murder and ""being crazy"". She asked the librarian for a personal meeting to introduce herself to the librarian so that the librarian could see that she was an ordained minister and wanted to show the librarian her degree in ministry. The librarian said that the patron is welcome to visit the library at any time. The patron immediately began to be very hostile and said ""So you are refusing to meet with me? I'm going to file a complaint about you with the county!"" The caller continued to say that five years ago there were two staff members that were spreading lies about her and that she was under the impression that they made things difficult for her in town. LTA KV was seated near DB during this phone call and was alarmed because she was able to overhear clearly what the patron was screaming at the librarian. When the librarian clarified that customers are able to use the library and are expected to adhere to a code of conduct the caller replied ""What about staff? Do they have rules of behavior?"" The librarian replied: ""Yes absolutely"". The caller continued to escalate and started to tell the librarian that she did not need to belittle the caller and that all she wanted was to do word processing. The librarian said that the computers are available to her whenever she was ready to come into the library. The caller kept ranting at the librarian that she didn't need to treat her like a child and that she was going to report her and started cursing at the librarian. The librarian stated that if the caller continued to be abusive, aggressive and threatening, that the librarian would need to end the call. When the caller repeatedly insulted the librarian, the librarian stated that the caller was welcome to call back, when they felt calmer, or could just come use the library when they were ready and ended the phone call.
 
When the librarian conferred with LA CS and described the call, CS identified the caller as MLP and shared that in the past this person had had difficulty interacting with staff in a respectful and neutral manner and would escalate during interactions with library staff after being asked to comply with library policies.

Patron looked at the desk and LA SB nodded that her dog needs to leave for the day. Librarian GT came out from the back room when she heard the barking. While patron was leaving she let her dog sniff our therapy dog, and her dog jumped, wanted to play, and continued to sniff and patron was just standing there. After about 15/20 seconds librarian GT said that the library is not a place to introduce dogs or have them play, and said the dog needs to go outside. Today, 3/10, patron came in with the dog and right after OSL III AB helped another patron in front of the desk, patron asked AB a question. Her dog jumped onto AB (above waist high), and patron lost control of the leash. After she regained it and took the dog off, AB came into the back to tell in charge librarians. Librarians GT and JNB went out to address the issue. GT said to the patron (who was at the computer) ""Your dog needs to leave for the day."" Patron asked GT ""why?""

He wanted staff to cancel the Our Space program and permanently stop serving food, as well as wanting to make a formal complaint about CR and get her food license revoked. CS gave him LSM EDL's phone number to make a complaint and talked with him about our food handling policy and where Our Space gets its food, after which he calmed down considerably.
Michelle reentered the library and went up to sit on the third floor. CS checked in with her to see if she was feeling better.

Teens Eric and Porter interrupted the program and began shouting and protesting the suspension of one of their friends, Maddux, who had been suspended 2 weeks earlier for arguing with staff and repeatedly not complying with staff requests. At this time L1 SG asked the youth to stop interrupting the program, which they did not. Shortly after, around 2:28pm, the youth who had been attending the program left the program and did not return. At 2:28pm, Zay (Xavius) entered the Large Community Room and began filming Eric and Porter interrupting the program and arguing with L1 SG. L1 SG asked the teens to leave the room if they would not discontinue their behavior and they did not immediately comply. L1 SG told Zay that he was not allowed to film other patrons inside of the library, and Zay complied with SG’s request and stopped filming. Because snacks are only allowed in the meeting rooms during a program Dorian and Zay continued watching Eric and Porter while they ate their chips. At 2:32pm Dorian, Jackson, Eric, Porter and Zay left the Large Community Room. At 2:33pm Eric and Porter returned after letting in Maddux, the suspended youth, into the building from the side door. Eric, Porter, Maddux, Emily, Andrea, Jackson and Zay all entered the Large Community Meeting Room. Eric and Porter began harassing L1 SG again, and teens Jackson, Zay, Emily and Andrea stood in the doorway and watched Eric and Porter. Again L1 SG asked the youth to stop and to leave. No one complied with SG’s request until she became upset, shut everything down and because she felt endangered felt the need to leave quickly. As SG walked quickly towards the door, suddenly all of the involved youth, (Zay, Jackson, Eric, Emily, Porter, Maddux and Amelia) ran through the hallway to get away around 2:34pm. On his way out Porter stole a large box of chips and ran into the bathroom with them. At 2:35pm youths Eric, Andrew and Liam assisted Porter with his theft by keeping a lookout for staff in the area, which they admitted to later. Around 2:45pm, Branch Manager SH was interrupted while helping a patron, and was told that an incident had occurred and that he needed to speak with SG. L3 SH went into the back staff room and noticed that SG was visibly upset. After speaking with SG, SH discovered that Eric and Porter had interrupted SG’s movie program along with some other youth. SH went to look for Eric and Porter. Eric and Porter had changed clothes while they were inside the Men’s restroom and attempted to hide from SH in the children’s area. SH found them and asked to speak with them. While SH was speaking to Eric and Porter SG informed SH that someone had also stolen a large box of chips from the program. At this point Andrew asked to be a part of the conversation. SH spoke with Eric, Porter, Andrew and Liam, and Porter told SH that someone had put the chips in the Men’s Restroom but would not identify the person. After SH found and returned the chips from the Men’s Restroom, SH spoke with Eric, Porter, Liam and Andrew again. SH told them that they had one chance to tell the truth before he confirmed on the cameras who had stolen the chips. Porter admitted that he stole the chips but that he was told to do so by Maddux. SH informed the youths that they would be suspended, but that he would need to speak with SG to determine the severity of the incident. After SH spoke with SG he realized that the youth were upset about their friend, Maddux, being suspended and were trying to protest his suspension from weeks earlier. However, when SG asked them to stop, they refused to do so, and when she asked them to leave they again refused to do so. SG informed SH that the youth crowded around the door, refused to stop their behavior and had prevented SG from leaving the room. This caused SG to fear for her safety, which is when SG made the decision to try to leave the room as quickly as possible to get away from the youth. SH then learned from surveillance camera footage that Eric, Porter and the other youth had left after harassing SG but then chose to return with the suspended youth, Maddux, and a larger audience (Zay, Jackson, Emily, and Andrea. After the incident SG was not able to continue their shift and had to leave for the day. Upon further investigation the next day SH discovered that other youth had informed staff that some of the 8th graders were trying to get SG fired. In addition, the youth left behind a paper with derogatory threatening messages towards SG. The paper said “10 signs for Ciara to get fucked” and then had the names of six of the male youth who have been mentioned during the incident. There is additional illegible scrawling on the page, and it appears that with some of the youth’s names along with the word “fucked” there was an attempt to scribble out the words.
The following youth will be suspended:
Eric – Eric will be suspended for 1 month for his attempt to bully and threaten SG, and his refusal to follow staff direction, and because he was one of the main perpetrators of the harassment that took place that caused SG to fear for their safety and due to his poor behavior has permanently ended a program for the remainder of the school year that will have an effect on many of the youth who visit the library each day.
Porter- Porter will be suspended for 1 month for his attempt to bully and threaten SG, his refusal to follow staff direction, his attempt at theft of library programming supplies, and for being the second main perpetrator of the harassment that took place that caused SG to fear for their safety and due to his poor behavior has permanently ended a program for the remainder of the school year that will have an effect on many of the youth who visit the library each day.
Jackson – Jackson will be suspended for 1 week for his participation and support in the harassment of staff that took place, which may have included blocking the doorway which prevented SG from exiting the room which caused SG to fear for their safety.
Dorian – Dorian will be suspended for 1 week for his participation and support in the harassment of staff that took place.
Xavius (Zay) – Zay will be suspended for 1 week for filming patrons inside of the library, and their continued participation and support of the harassment of staff that took place, which may have included blocking the doorway which prevented SG from exiting the room which caused SG to fear for their safety.
Maddux – Maddux will have his current 1 month suspension extended for 1 week longer because of his trespassing, and his participation or support of harassment of staff that took place and for blocking SG from exiting the room which caused SG to fear for their safety.
Emily – Emily will be suspended for 1 week for choosing to be a bystander and blocking SG from exiting the room which caused SG to fear for their safety.
Andrea – Andrea will be suspended for 1 week for choosing to be a bystander and blocking SG from exiting the room which caused SG to fear for their safety.
Andrew – Andrew will be suspended for 1 week for choosing to assist Porter with his attempted theft of library programming supplies.
Liam – Liam will be suspended for 1 week for choosing to assist Porter with his attempted theft of library programming supplies.
 
Per recommendation of LRPY members, SH will also be meeting with the youth and their guardians to discuss the reasons for their suspensions, and the harm that has been caused by their poor decisions.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0045",1,2023-04-27,0-01-01 17:44:00,"17:44:00","05:44:00 PM","Wheeler Taft Abbett",0-01-01 17:00:00,"17:00-17:59"

Mr Riley, who was sitting a computer station surrounded by books he'd pulled from the shelf, deliberately opened a book and looked away. I asked again if he was okay and he he grunted and motioned for me to move away. I let him know that staff had already approached him about his excessive noise making and that he was welcome to stay but that he would just need to keep things quieter. At that point, he ripped a page out of the book and got up. I let him know that because of that I'd have to ask him to leave for the day. He made some unintelligible noises and proceeded to walk to the front door--at the front door he stopped and carefully tore out a small section of words from the page he ripped out and showed me the page with a hole in it and then took off.

LA NM approached the patron and let him know that the library was now closed, and that it was time for him to leave for the day. The patron briefly looked away from the video on his phone to acknowledge LA NM with eye contact and a nod before returning to his video. Daniel remained seated and did not make any motion to leave. LA NM repeated that the branch was closed, and that he needed to make his way out so staff could close the building. LA NM shared that she would give him a couple minutes to gather his things, and that she would return soon.
When LA NM returned, she let Daniel know that, at this point, by refusing to leave after closing time, he was trespassing. The patron remained seated and appeared to be ignoring LA NM. LA NM then stated that she would need to call 911 to have police escort the patron out of the building if they did not leave of their own accord. She then asked VetSec guard VM to reiterate this information to the patron. When Daniel did not respond to guard VM's request to leave, LA NM stepped away and called 911 (5:07pm).
L1 WW shared that he recognized this patron from previous interactions and that he was actively suspended (PITS incident 21593).
By 5:30 pm, Daniel had not left the building, though he stood up once to get water from the drinking fountain by the bathrooms. As he did this, LTA-S FC closed and locked the sliding glass doors that separate the bathroom hallway from the main body of the library building. Daniel stayed in the entryway, looking inside and walking back and forth for several minutes without leaving. Security camera footage captures somewhat erratic behavior at this time, including lying down briefly and waving at the door sensors and cameras. LA NM made a follow-up call to 911 to share the identity of the patron and that he was already under an active suspension from all library properties. 
After a few more minutes by the bathrooms, Daniel made his way outside the building and remained in the entry/parking lot area. Since Daniel was still on the grounds, staff and guard VM could not leave and close the Valencia BLVD gate, since their cars were still in the lot, and there had been a record of threatening behavior with this patron. Staff waited until Daniel walked off of the grounds near the bus stop before exiting the building and closing the gates. LA NM cancelled the 911 call at 5:56 pm, after the gate had been locked and the branch fully closed.

She often spreads out her personal belongings across several computer stations and/or furniture in laptop area and displays territorial/hostile behavior towards nearby patrons. She also remains in study rooms for an excessive amount of time after closing and argues with staff when reminded of library hours and patron expectations.

FA noticed that patron Isabella had a large amount of belongings spread out across a couple computer stations and chairs in last row of public PCs, but was not utilizing any of the PCs. FA asked her to please not take up more than one computer station as it blocks other patrons’ access. Isabella then told FA to monitor people talking on the phone and children being loud and that the patrons can sit someplace else. FA responded that he was only asking her to share the space with other patrons who may wish to use it. Isabella kept trying to argue and FA returned to help the patrons on PCs 9 & 10. Isabella attempted to continue to argue with FA and made two the patrons whom he was helping uncomfortable. FA apologized to the other patrons to de-escalate the situation. At that point, Isabella got up to go the service desk to issue a complaint with Sub Lib CFD.

There was no prior interaction between the two patrons. Both patrons left the building, headed in opposite directions, before a staff member could intervene.
At approximately 12:00, the male patron came back into the library and sat on the third floor, talking loudly on his cell phone with his feet on the table. Guard J asked him to take his call in the stairwell and not put his feet on the table. He called Guard J a ""he-she"" and insulted her looks before returning to his phone call.
LIC CS spoke to the man and told him that he couldn't call people names inside the library. He told her that he had called the other patron a ""self-entitled witch,"" not a bitch, and that free speech meant that was fine. CS asked him to leave for the day, as his behavior was violating the code of conduct and he refused to change it. She offered him a copy of the code, and he proceeded to read each clause out loud and talk about how he hadn't done those things because of free speech. CS told him several times that he needed to leave, and eventually let him know that if he did not she would have to call the police. He told her he was going to call the police on her instead. After several iterations of the same conversation, he asked for and was given CS's manager's number and left the library.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0026",1,2023-05-11,0-01-01 12:08:00,"12:08:00","12:08:00 PM","Joel D.

The child's parent and sibling were present in the library, but they were not in the same area at the time. When the child (a young girl) returned to her parent, LA NM kept an eye on the other patron (George) to see if he approached her again or continued his attention toward her.
Later, upon noticing that George sat down within eye line of the minor, LA NM left the front desk to present coloring pages to the girl and sit down with her at a table that was within eyesight of the child's parent but out of eyesight of George's seat.
Within a few minutes, George walked by, addressed the child sitting next to LA NM, and asked the girl if she wanted part of his open chocolate bar. LA NM emphatically said, ""No, thank you,"" and gestured for Guard VM to come over while George walked away. LA NM asked Guard VM to keep an eye on George and to be present should he approach again and need to be asked to leave.
In the next few minutes, George walked back and sat back down at a table closer to LA NM and the girl. LA NM and the young patron continued to color until the child's parent had finished their work and was able to be fully present with the child. LA NM noticed that George continued to stare in the direction of her and the young patron. At this point, it was closing time, and everyone was packing up to leave.
George once again approached LA NM and the girl and tried to show them both a Bible verse, saying that it was ""miraculous"" that the girl appeared in the library when she did. LA NM asked him to pack up his things, as his continued gaze and interactions were not appropriate, and the branch was also closing. He packed up and left before follow-up could take place.

He then told the guard it was a gun and asked if he could give it into her. VetSec guard VM refused to take the weapon and asked the patron what type of gun it was. Patron (George) then told VetSec guard VM, “I don’t know, maybe a pellet gun.” VetSec guard VM then asked the patron to talk to the librarians about it. He then said, “I do not want to talk to them.” VetSec guard VM then again asked him what type of gun it was. The patron then shouted, “it’s a pistol, okay?!” VetSec guard then came and told L1 VM what was going on. VetSec guard VM emphasized that she thought the patron was angry. The patron’s behavior along with his indication of having a weapon alarmed L1 VM.
L1 VM called LSM EDL and LSM VL to get advice on how to proceed. LSM VL advised L1 VM to call 911.
At 3:03pm L1 VM called 911 and informed them that there was a patron potentially armed with a gun in the library. L1 VM also let 911 dispatch know that this patron had been involved in a few incidents before and that we were concerned there might be some mental health issues associated with his behavior. 911 dispatch told L1 VM they would be sending an officer soon.
At 3:38pm L1 VM received a call from 911 and asked if she could provide a more accurate description of the patron. L1 VM provided the description and let them know he was still in the library. At this point the patron (George) was on one of the computers near the study rooms. 911 dispatch again told L1 VM that an officer would be responding soon.
At 3:48 patron (George) got up from the computer to use the bathroom. The patron remained in the bathroom alone for 10 minutes before he proceeded to exit the library. When the patron walked out of the library, LTA GG locked the double doors to the building and L1 VM called and informed LSM EDL that Valencia was on lockdown. At the same time, 4 police cars pulled into the parking lot. As patron (George) was attempting to ride away on his bike, officers approached him, and they got into a heated exchange with the patron. At one point he called the officers, “assholes” which resulted in them putting him in handcuffs. The officers did recover a gun from his backpack.  
After talking to patron (George) for about 15 minutes, officers let him go. He rode away on his bike.

Librarian JNB told him that she had not noticed them being too loud but would pay closer attention to them. After about 10 minutes they got louder again and JNB went over and asked them to please lower their voices. They complied.
About 30 minutes later Librarian JNB noticed they were eating out of a bag of chips that were coated in a red flavor. As she noticed this the boys mother walked over. JNB approached and said ""You probably were not aware but we do not allow eating at the computers. You may take them to the table to eat just not at the computer."" The older boy responded by saying I do this every other day and no one has ever said anything. When JNB responded with I am sorry but we need to protect our computer equipment and keep it sanitary for others the boy said, ""That is why I pushed my chair back"" His chair was pushed back 6 inches at most. At this point JNB said, ""Other staff just haven't noticed before but it is in our customer code of conduct if you would like a copy I can get you one."" Throughout this exchange Mom just stood there, starring at JNB and saying nothing. After a moment of silence in which the boys continued to eat out of the chip bag JNB said I am waiting for you to remove the food from the computers and if you don't comply I will ask you to leave for the day.

Early in the 2pm hour, an OV Police officer asked DM if there was another policeman in the library. DM responded that DM did not know. The officer then went to go look around.
Shortly thereafter, DM saw 3 OVPD walking by the catalog desks headed towards the book shop. At this point, DM went to alert the ""in charge"" person who was RW. DM found her in the Children's section and let her know that there were 3 cops in the library. DM did not know the reason why but DM thought the person in-charge should know ASAP.
At 2:48pm a woman came out of the restroom screaming to call 911, that the ""naked man"" the police were looking for was in the ladies restroom. DM immediately called 911 because:

OVPD was just there, DM didn't know the reason why, but DM figured it may have been because they were looking for this man who was now hiding in the restroom. The cops had just left so DM figured they may still be in the parking lot (and the station is literally next to the library).
Because of the lady's adamancy and sense of urgency that there may have been a dangerous man in the restroom, and after all, at least 3 police were just in the library perhaps looking for him.

It took a few minutes for the police to arrive and in the meantime the woman told us about how this same man was seen by her earlier in the parking lot, and that he was naked from the waist down, and that she went immediately to her car and locked the door and drove away for her safety. She asserted that this was now the same man that she saw in the restroom.
The police showed up and found no one that fit the description of being a ""naked man.""
At this point there was a change in desk duties but was informed during the next hour that the same lady was at the desk still insisting on what she saw, adamant in her claims.
Based on my own conclusions, the lady may have been the one who called the police the first time, or was the cause of their presence at the library earlier in the 2 o'clock hour. However, the police never let us know what they were there for so we didn't know how big a danger there was, if any. We didn't even know they were looking for a ""naked man"" or any person.
When the woman alerted me to call 911 after leaving the restroom, this would have been her third (at least) sighting of the ""naked man"" or something she thought resembled that.
All evidence appears to show that there was no ""naked man"" and that the lady may have been confused. There was a man wearing two-toned shorts that were gray that could have been the cause of confusion. OVPD also alerted staff that this woman is known to them as someone who calls a lot. There were 6 OVPD that showed up.
Library staff should be on alert for any future claims by this woman, especially since they can unintentionally lead to accidental harm on an innocent suspect especially if police consider them a threat based on her claims.","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0085",0,2023-07-01,0-01-01 14:48:00,"14:48:00","02:48:00 PM","Oro Valley",0-01-01 14:00:00,"14:00-14:59"

Gary was in a wheelchair and wearing hospital scrubs. Librarian KB brought them to the couch in the café area, near an outlet. Gary said he was “thrown out” of St. Joseph’s Hospital and that they had nowhere to go. Nancy indicated that they had been in a hotel, but were tossed out, along with all their belongings. KB returned to the service desk to help with other customers. After about 10 minutes, VetSec guard TE approached KB, telling her that a customer said two dogs were tied up outside on the SE patio by the large meeting room door. KB went with TE to investigate. Two dogs were tied up to the bench, and there was a black, soft-sided carrier under the bench. The customer indicated that a cat was in the carrier. There was no water available to the animals. KB went back inside to the staff room and asked staff to retrieve the cat carrier and get water for the dogs. KB went back onto the library floor to find the owners. KB was stopped by Nancy and Gary, who again asked for water. KB brought them a couple of bottles, at which time Nancy asked if it was OK to bring in their pets because they were currently tied up outside. KB told them that library staff was aware that there were animals tied up and that they had been brought into the staff area to get them out of the sun and heat (the temperature at the time was over 105F). KB asked what they were planning to do when the library closed at 6pm, and Nancy said they didn’t know because shelters would not accept animals.
The next 3 hours were spent trying to find people who could take the animals temporarily and to find shelter for the couple. Nancy applied online with PACC to foster the animals while they got back on their feet; however, even if the couple were approved for this service, the process of placing the pets would take a few days. Nancy and Gary were not able to find shelter for themselves because of the late hour and the fact that the next day was the July 4th holiday. At closing, the couple left with one dog. The other dog was brought to PACC. The cats (there were 2 in the carrier) were placed temporarily with a staff member. (As an aside, PACC turned away the dog because she arrived too close to closing.)
The next day, July 4, around 3:15pm, concerned about the couple being in the heat without shelter, Librarian JD drove by the branch to see if they were still there. They were, and JD dropped off some water and food for them. Librarian KB drove by around 6 or 6:30pm and the couple was no longer at the library. KB spoke with a regular customer who uses the wi-fi after closing most nights, and he said that on the night of July 3 paramedics answered a call about the couple (he didn’t know if the couple or someone else called 911) and brought them back to St. Joseph’s Hospital. Wi-fi guy told KB that the couple had just been walked over to St. Joseph’s Hospital by paramedics again, about an hour before KB arrived to check on them.
At 8:00am, on Wednesday, July 5, paramedics did a welfare check of the couple, assisted Gary into his wheelchair, and left.  At 8:10am, Librarian I JM and Librarian III KK approached the couple, who were camped in front of Wilmot’s entrance. The couple shared that the man had suffered heatstroke at a bus stop on Monday after being evicted from a hotel and the bus driver had administered chest compressions while waiting for paramedics.  They said that St. Joseph’s Hospital had stabilized Gary and then “kicked them out” when their ride fell through. They said that their phone had died, which further complicated their efforts to get help, including needed medications.  KK offered to call the local crisis line, explaining that camping on library grounds was not allowed. They agreed. Staff called the Homeless Resource Line, the Community Wide Crisis Line, Karl Wagner with CWD, and Bethanie at the Sullivan Center but none of these entities was able to assist the couple. Multiple shelters were called, and all were full that night.
The couple spent the day in the library making many unsuccessful phone calls for help. At closing, L1 KB purchased clothing for them and gave them cab fare so that they could try to get to Salvation Army and hopefully be given shelter the next day.","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","No","No","ID_0027",1,2023-07-03,0-01-01 15:20:00,"15:20:00","03:20:00 PM","Murphy-Wilmot",0-01-01 15:00:00,"15:00-15:59"

The patron had already spoken to LTA KV that morning to let her know too that she does not like LA CS and that she will not speak to her again because her perception of CS is that CS is unfriendly.
Having observed numerous interactions with this patron and having had my own, this patron reacts negatively to being redirected toward library business, or when staff does not engage in conversation about personal medical information, such as extremely detailed medical symptoms.

Rather than saying he understood and would comply, he told the library representative to go away and leave him alone.
He frequently brings his dog into the library.  In the past, the animal barked at another dog when the two owners were standing next to each other at the community food bank cart. On multiple occasions the dog jumped on the front desk. He stands on his hind legs and puts his paws on the desk. He is friendly. He is just trying to play, but it is not the behavior of a service animal. Today, the dog was observed pulling the owner and straining against his leash to run toward a child. He was not aggressive, he wanted to play, but when the owner walked the dog over to the child, the dog jumped on the boy.    
LA, CS, approached and explained to the patron that only service dogs were allowed in the library, and even a service dog is required to behave well. It was explained that his dog’s behavior was not appropriate for the library.
He responded by saying that was not posted anywhere. It was pointed out that there is a sign to that effect on each side of the front door. He then asked why it was being enforced now and it was explained to him that we just observed his dog jump on someone else’s child.
He replied that he couldn’t control his dog anymore that he already was, and the library personnel should just go away and leave him alone.
At that point, the LA got the branch manager who, along with the security officer, spoke to the gentleman outside the building. He falsely claimed the LA was rude to him and was picking on him. He also claimed the White House said dogs are allowed everywhere.

KS went to introduce herself, saying ""Hi! I'm Kaitlyn the manager at the Oro Valley Library"". He did not offer his name. KS let the individual know where he could set up. The gentleman in the tan shirt argued with her about where he could set up and said that she was being partisan. After repeating several times that this was a policy that EVERYONE is asked to follow regardless of their group, the tan shirt man said he was ""handicapped"" and was awaiting his partner to help move the table. KS said ""okay, when your partner is here, this is where the table can go"" and even showed him where the table could go walking to the exact spot and gesturing with arms wide to show where the table could be set up. 
When KS went out again, the man was attempting to put an American flag on a 6ft pole on the book lockers; it fell and he took it down as she arrived to give him the Petition Passing Policy ""to help answer some of his questions he asked"". Shortly after the tan shirt man started filming the other petitioner passer, a woman, and arguing with her. (She had arrived there first and had her table where requested). KS went to speak to both of them. She let them both know separately that they would need to leave for the day if they did not discontinue shouting. The woman shook KS's hand, apologized and said she was packing up to leave. The tan shirt man repeatedly filmed the other petition passer and continued to bicker with her; she did yell back at them. He also argued with KS that what she was telling him wasn't Arizona State Law; KS told him we have our own Code of Conduct that we enforce. He continued to say this did not supersede state law. One of the items he was referring to specifically is that she said ""so that you are aware you can film in front of the library, but not INSIDE the library"". He also asked her if she was going to tell him he couldn't have a gun next (he had a gun holstered on his hip); she told him ""No. Patrons are permitted to carry firearms."" 
Another woman arrived who appeared to be with the tan shirt man and she seemed to listen to KS and agree with discussing the petition passing policy but with the other man continuing to interrupt while KS tried to speak with the woman. (She also had a gun holstered on her hip, which is uncommon at this library location and noted here as the police asked for this information before they came.) However, she was not tabling with the tan shirt man and set up a separate table once the first petition passer vacated her ""better spot"" by the door. Her table was for a politician who later arrived and was on site at his table. (KS brought both groups the petition passing policy and code of conduct highlighted. The woman accepted it and was polite. The tan shirt man filmed her while she explained it. Another man jumped in and asked KS to take her mask off. KS said ""no"". The tan shirt man then said it was a political statement that she was making. KS finished going over the code of conduct letting the tan shirt man know that if he would be unable to follow the policy she would have to ask him to leave for the day. The highlighted portions she talked to him about are what are listed as infractions in this report.
The tan shirt man finally moved his table but blocked one of the book drops. KS went to speak to him again showing him how his table was blocking the book drop and asked him to move it from under the book drop. She also requested that he not stand in front of the doorways since he was not at his table but standing in front of the door. He continued to try to engage her about AZ State Law - KS said she would not discuss that with him and he needed to follow library policy or she would be trespassing him for the day. She asked if he could follow our policy and he did not say ""yes"" so she left and called 911 - it had been over 45 minutes of repeated interactions at this point where the man would not follow direction with much effort and argument. (She also asked the other group of the woman and politician to try to keep their line down the sidewalk as they were also blocking the doors and the side door.)
The 3 police officers in bullet proof vests arrived. (The majority of the group outside left, approximately 10 people in front of the doors, as the police vehicles pulled up.) KS told the police what was happening; yelling, blocking the doorway, not setting up where requested and arguing when asking to stop these behaviors. She showed the police the policy and code of conduct that she gave the man, highlighting another copy for the police. At the time the police were talking to KS a patron had just come in to report that she felt harassed and that the group in front of the doors were yelling about ""incest"" and other topics; she told the police this as well. (KS had offered the patron to exit through the staff door if she felt uncomfortable and she declined.) The police asked if the tan shirt man would follow the code of conduct and library policy, if he could stay. KS told them yes, however she had been asking for over 45 minutes and he only argued with her, so if he continued he would be ""trespassed"" for the day and need to be removed from the premises. The police took the policy and code of conduct and spoke to him. They came back to report he would comply, and he appeared to comply for most of the afternoon. 
Later a call came in from a woman that the man in the tan shirt had called her ""a bum"" while she returned her books and told him ""no"" she didn't want to talk to him. She asked ""What did you say?"" and his response was ""well, if the shoe fits."" 
As the groups were cleaning up, KS went to talk to the politician and thanked him for doing what he could to keep his group from blocking the door and apologized for any confusion as she was repeatedly interrupted when trying to communicate with his colleague about where to set up in front of the library. She said he was welcome back and better explained where he could set up. KS then went to speak to the man in the tan shirt about a concern a patron brought forward about him calling someone a bum. He said she was lying. The politician then came up and said the woman was rude. KS said she was sorry to hear that and asked that if they wanted to be in front of the library, they would need to not retaliate and could tell staff.  KS said to him that if he came back he needs to follow library policy and code of conduct or she would ask him to leave. The tan shirt man started arguing about state law. KS said she already spent over an hour talking him today and she would not discuss AZ State Law with him and walked away. He took down and carried his own table away. He yelled at her that she was a ""narcissist and that was a narcissist's response."" The politician shook his head and walked away.","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0033",1,2023-08-01,0-01-01 12:40:00,"12:40:00","12:40:00 PM","Oro Valley",0-01-01 12:00:00,"12:00-12:59"

MS asked the customer to leave and also offered medical assistance. The customer purchased snacks from the vending machine on the 1st floor on their way out as MS accompanied them and then left the building. Around 3:05 PM, in-charge staff were alerted that the customer had returned and was outside the front doors, throwing money near the doors and asking for food and yelling. L3 LAF responded, with L2 JM accompanying. The customer was not found throwing money, but was shirtless and shoeless and smoking next to the building and pacing. The customer's shirt and shoes were under the front awning and he had been sitting on them. LAF took guard I outside, greeted the customer, and asked them not to smoke within 20 feet of the building. LAF asked if he was okay and if there was someone they could call for help. The customer yelled, ""they're already here"". LAF went back inside the building and monitored the situation with guard I and spoke with staff at the desk. LAF informed staff that they should call crisis response. Staff at the desk called in-charge staff member MG to call crisis response. Once MG arrived, the customer's behavior had already escalated and they were pacing back and forth in front of the building and punching the building exterior and windows. LAF took guard I with her and went outside to address the customer's behavior. LAF told the customer she could offer two options, they could either sit down and peacefully await crisis response outside and library staff would call them (to which the customer began yelling again, ""they're already here""), or they could leave the premises. She said she was sorry she didn't have any food to give them. At this point, the customer went over to their belongings and said they would ""walk all over this damn city"" and LAF and guard I both saw that the customer had a small machete and another tactical dagger of some kind next to their possessions. The customer put on their socks and shoes and picked up the machete in one hand and the other knife in the other. He approached, LAF took a few steps back and guard I stepped toward LAF.

On the first floor, two young men were shouting at each other, pointing fingers, and threatening each other. One of the men was Hodgie (sp?), and the other person was younger, possibly a teen. A young woman/teen was with him. Apparently, a few days previous, the teen had thrown a rock at Hogie and hit him in the face. When the teen came into the library, at first they were talking calmly, but soon that erupted into an argument. By the time mg arrived, the guard was getting them outside, attempting to de-escalate the situation, and the young woman was trying to separate the two fighters. They continued the argument outside, but eventually the teens walked away. After letting off a little steam to the guard and mg, Hogie returned to a computer. 
Mg later learned that Hodgie sometimes had a firearm in his backpack. She discussed this with LF and accompanied LF to talk to Hogie about library policy and safety. Hodgie said he already gave his weapon to a friend who left the library because he could see it wasn't safe to have it, and he had forgotten about the laws regarding firearms in government buildings. That is, minors cannot have them at all, and adults can carry firearms only if they are properly secured in a holster. Hodgie then returned to the computer. 
The teen was about 5'7"", white, with thick, light brown hair. He has a stocky build.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0095",0,2023-08-28,0-01-01 13:30:00,"13:30:00","01:30:00 PM","Joel D. Valdez-Main",0-01-01 13:00:00,"13:00-13:59"

LTA GG informed L1 VM of the situation. Upon further investigation, L1 VM found camera footage of an adult male keying the female patron’s car.
Around 1:49pm a dark blue Chevy pickup truck pulled into the parking lot and parked next to the adult female patron’s car.

Details are noted below.
On 9/18/2023, an unknown adult male--UAM (photo is attached) came into Valenica library and used a guest pass to sign onto computer #13. During his visit he experienced issues with the sound on his computer. LA NM attempted to troubleshoot the issue with the patron but was unable to get the sound working again. LA NM then came and got 2 of Valencia’s tech liaisons, L1 VM and LTA GG. L1 VM and LTA GG were also unable to get the sound working and advised him to move to the computer next to him. The patron then said he liked that computer and did not want to move. He then asked if they could get the staff member that was helping him previous because, “she knew what she was doing”. L1 VM then told him that she was working on other tasks, and they were able to help him now. He persisted and asked for them to go get the “short little brunette” because she fixed it for him before. It was understood that he was asking specifically for NM who had helped previously, but who had NOT been able to resolve the audio issue. On 9/18/23, UAM asked for help from “the short brunette” 3 separate times. LTA GG let UAM know that his best solution for the audio issues would be to log in to the computer next to him or continue his session without sound. He then moved to the next computer.
On Tuesday 8/29/23 around 3pm. Patron “UAM” was at the same computer (#13), and he came to the front desk and asked for help with his computer sound. At the time LTA KG and L1 VM were on desk together. LTA KG went over to help him. The patron explained that the sound was not working on his computer. He then repeatedly asked LTA KG to go get the “short brown-haired girl” with a “slim build” because she was able to help him last time. He also told LTA KG that she was about, “23 years old” and asked LTA KG if she knew who he was talking about. LTA KG did not know who he was asking about, and told him so, then advised him to move to another computer. When LTA KG told L1 VM about the odd conversation, L1 VM realized that he was referring to LA NM. Concerned for LA NM’s safety due to the bizarre nature of the interactions, L1 VM then informed L3 IR what was going on. L3 IR then took her desk hour the following hour so LA NM did not have to interact with him.
The concerning aspects of the repeated interactions with UAM were that 1) he used the same computer, which he knew had an audio issue, an issue for which he had been given a solution and 2) when he asked for help, he was not describing the issue he was having, or the work he was trying to get done, but rather he has focusing his words and phrases to describe the staffmember with an unsettling attention to details describing her physique. UAM was adamant to have staff look for her to provide one-on-one assistance, which indicated sexist undertones and an unfounded attachment; this along with the repetitive nature of his requests made staff feel harassed and distressed. 
The next day on Wednesday 8/30 around 1230pm the same patron at the same computer asked LTA GG, for help with the sound on his computer. LTA GG then went over to help him. In that conversation, he again started to describe a ""short brown-haired girl"" and asked LTA GG if he could get her to help him since she helped him last time. LTA GG suggested to have UAM move to the next computer if he was having sound issues again. LTA GG then let the librarian in charge, L1 VM, know what was going on. L1 VM then reached out to VAL’s LSM before talking to the patron.
L1 VM and LTA GG approached the patron, who was now at a computer inside the lab. L1 VM took him outside the lab so the conversation would not be heard by other patrons. L1 VM then introduced herself and told the patron she was in charge and understood he was having persistent issues with the sound on his computer. L1 VM then explained that any staff member at the branch could help him with his computer issues and made it clear he needed to stop asking for one specific staff member. The patron then explained that he was only asking for her because she fixed the issue last time. This was not an accurate statement. L1 VM reiterated that any staff member could help him and said he needed to stop asking for her. L1 VM also advised him to not use that specific computer anymore since it kept giving him issues.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0001",1,2023-08-30,0-01-01 12:30:00,"12:30:00","12:30:00 PM","Valencia",0-01-01 12:00:00,"12:00-12:59"

LSM VL and VS Guard went out again to present the letter to Tony Burgis, since they stayed on the SRO patio, and they refused to take the letter. They denied the incident until they were told by LSM VL that the incident was on camera, was observed and smelt. They are aware they have a one year suspension from all libraries, but refused the suspension letter. They left the property.","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0041",1,2023-09-05,0-01-01 12:13:00,"12:13:00","12:13:00 PM","Santa Rosa",0-01-01 12:00:00,"12:00-12:59"

The interaction was quickly escalating toward conflict between the two patrons so L1 AB told them that they needed to not argue with each other, that they need to come to staff with their issues. Patron A insisted again that we should call the police, but Patron B wasn't wielding any weapons at that moment. Patron A then quickly asked if ""we"" should call the police and L1 AB said that he was welcome to do what he felt he needed to, but L1 AB wanted to get both sides of the story first (as Patron B is a regular and hasn't displayed violent behavior in the past). Patron A then said he was dropping it and left out the front door as Patron B went back toward the bathrooms again. When Patron B came back to the computer area, L1 AB followed up with him to make sure he was okay. Patron B stated that Patron A ""came at"" him in the bathroom, but he was okay. He refused to make eye contact and didn't seem to want to further explain, so L1 AB left him at the computer.
 
After being filled in on the incident, L3 CB checked the camera in our hallway facing the bathroom for photos for the incident. In the footage, Patron A is seen filling jugs of water at the bottle filling station and Patron B stands at a distance. The patrons appear to be talking, then Patron B enters the bathroom.

My colleague Library Associate RS and I were setting up our book display for the 9-15 El Grito event at the El Rio Center in the other room, so did not become aware of the inappropriate conduct until another regular patron in the computer room (the only other patron in the branch at the time) yelled out that ""someone was smoking in there"". This occurred at about 5:52pm. I immediately hurried over to the computer room and saw that the patron had lit a cigar at his station. I informed him that smoking is prohibited in the library, and if he did not extinguish the cigar immediately he would have to leave. He complied right away. A few minutes later, I approached him again and informed him we were about to close and requested that he start gathering his belongings. He complied but left behind an extremely rotten banana. When we were first alerted to the situation, I tried to contact the El Rio security team via text to request that they come check on us just in case the situation escalated.

A distinct smell of marijuana was in the space. LAF tried to discern the origin, but was unable to. LAF asked TW about the smell and TW said the smell just started and that Cayden and Damian had just arrived when it did. Guard J was present in the space at the time and smelled marijuana also. Cayden and Damian had been sitting in front of the windows, watching people on the street and making fun of them, calling them expletive-filled names, specifically one person they referred to as a fat b*tch multiple times. They transitioned over to the computers. After a few minutes, their language became extremely inappropriate with nothing but expletives and slurs, mainly n*gga. LAF approached and told them to stop or they’d need to leave. They said okay and stopped. Some time later, they left 101 space. LAF said goodbye as they left and they said they’d be back. Guard J told LAF they were heading for the Ignite space. LAF said they needed to keep an eye on them. A few minutes later, guard J headed over to the Ignite space. She came back and reported to LAF that it smelled like marijuana over there. At this point, LAF began hearing Cayden and Damian loudly shout expletives and slurs from the Ignite space and the pair could be heard yelling loudly all the way from 101. LAF approached and said it smelled like marijuana and that she shouldn’t be able to hear them across the entirety of the second floor shouting expletives and slurs. She asked them to leave. Damian said they weren’t smoking weed and LAF said, okay if they weren’t smoking weed, but that they were still yelling across the entire second floor. Damian said it was “bullshit”, called LAF “booboo” or “boobear” and said she was “just having a bad day and to go home and take it out on some kids or something”. Damian began leaving and told a third person with them that they needed to leave, too. LAF said, “I didn’t ask him to leave”. Cayden accused LAF of telling him to “get his n*gro a*ss out of the library”. LAF did not say this. Guard J told Cayden to stop saying that and told them they were putting words in LAF’s mouth she didn’t say. Damian continued with insulting remarks toward LAF and using expletives all the way out of the building. Cayden followed Damian out slowly.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0055",1,2023-09-22,0-01-01 14:15:00,"14:15:00","02:15:00 PM","Joel D. Valdez-Main",0-01-01 14:00:00,"14:00-14:59"

At this time SH noticed a youth running through the library. He immediately followed the youth to address their misconduct. As SH was speaking with the youth who identified their self as Ichella, other youth approached SH and Ichella. One of the male youth who approached SH immediately addressed Ichella and asked why she hit his brother. SH addressed the youth and asked to speak to each of them to understand what was going on. SH first spoke with Ichella who said that the male youth who had followed them had been calling their friend and them names. SH asked Ichella if Ichella hit the boy who was claiming that Ichella had hit. Ichella said they pushed on the back of their head or their back because the boy was making fun of Ichella and their friends. SH went over the Code of Conduct with the youth and explained that if at any time there were issues that youth should let the library staff know rather than taking care of it themselves. Ichella said that their parent was waiting and asked to leave at 3:30pm. SH then spoke with the other youth and learned that according to them Ichella had walked up to the young boy, Santiago, and asked him if he called her friend ""fat"". Santiago said he replied that no he didn't know the girl and wouldn't call anyone names. Santiago then reported that he turned back around to his computer to play Roblox and was immediately punched in the back of his head, which caused his face to hit the computer screen. That is when Austin, and Santiago's brother, Adan, began to chase down Ichella. While speaking with Santiago and the other boys, Santiago's mother arrived. At this point Santiago was crying and saying his head hurt. SH gave Santiago an ice pack and began to take down everyone's information after realizing that Santiago may have been assaulted without provocation and in order to fill out an injury report. At this point Santiago's mother stated she would be calling the school. SH explained that he would be following up with the youth assailant, and gave Santiago's mother his information in case she had further questions. Santiago and his brother and mother left shortly after. At approximately 4:13pm Marana Police Department Officer, Barker #573 arrived with Santiago's mother. SH was alerted by staff that an officer was waiting to speak with him. Santiago's mother left immediately after arriving with the MPD officer. Officer Barker requested any information that SH could give about the assault and gave SH his information along with the report number. (DR# 2309-1174). After his initial investigation, Officer Barker informed SH that he believed an unprovoked assault did take place and that there was evidence of physical harm that took place due to significant swelling in the affected area where Santiago was punched. Officer Barker left at 4:26pm. Considering the unprovoked attack by Ichella that caused significant harm to Santiago, Ichella will be suspended for 1 year.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0045",1,2023-09-22,0-01-01 16:28:00,"16:28:00","04:28:00 PM","Wheeler Taft Abbett",0-01-01 16:00:00,"16:00-16:59"

Around 11:45 , the guard let LIC CR know that a patron in the cafe area was in crisis. The woman was doubled over in one of the lounge chairs crying so hard she couldn't speak and moaning to herself. CR sat on the end table next to the woman, trying to get a name or any information. After a minute, CR went to the staff room and asked someone to call 911 and ask for the mental health crisis team. CR returned to the woman, who was still nonresponsive. The woman began hitting herself in the head. CR asked her not to hit herself and the woman stopped after a few hits, but had been crying so hard she began to vomit and have an asthma attack. She was able to use her inhaler after about five minutes.
NG's description: 11:50am-ish, I called the Community-Wide Crisis Line 520-622-6000 and explained we had a patron who was having a mental health crisis and we needed someone immediately.  They advised me to call 911 if we needed immediate help.  I called 911 and was routed to police department, and when I asked that they send someone with mental health crisis exp, they asked if we had a name, asked for physical description, etc. I explained she was unresponsive to us and was in crisis and needed transport, but they would send someone to assess the situation.  LIC CR let me know we needed medical help at this point, I called back 911 and explained we needed medical assistance due to how severe her crisis is and that she was unresponsive, I handed the phone to LIC CR for further talk while I sat with the patron. 
LA NG had approached to say that she had called 911. CR asked her to call back and ask for an immediate transport. NG told CR that the operator was telling her that a crisis team was already en route. CR asked to speak to the operator. She told the operator that the patron was non-responsive, vomiting and having an asthma attack, and that she had said she wants to die. The 911 operator said that it was a job for the mental health crisis team and they were already on their way. Patron had still refused to give her name or any details to this point. The only things she kept repeating were ""I want to die"" and ""why did this happen to me?""   
CR sat with the woman until 12:30 when two men from the crisis unit responded. At this point, the woman had calmed down and was curled up under a jacket resting. She was still unable to answer questions and her hands and feet were jerking and her eyelids were twitching. They tried to speak to the woman, who was still awake but unable to answer any questions. After asking her name a couple of times, the men said they had to step outside to speak to their supervisor. When they came back in they told CR that they couldn't do anything for the woman because she refused to respond. They suggested that she call 911 again and have the woman trespassed so the police could take her off the property. 
At 12:50 CR told the woman that the crisis team said they could not help but that she didn't want to have to charge the woman with trespassing in order to get her help. CR suggested sleeping for a little while and seeing how it went from there.  At 3:40 she was sleeping. CR asked her to wake up and checked in with her. She said her name was Tiana and that she would be able to comply with our instructions and would be able to leave at 5 PM.","Yes","No","Yes","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","ID_0054",0,2023-09-23,0-01-01 11:45:00,"11:45:00","11:45:00 AM","Eckstrom-Columbus",0-01-01 11:00:00,"11:00-11:59"

The librarian greeted the customer and asked if she would accompany her to speak to her outside. Mary Pieta immediately became verbally hostile and told the librarian that she was there to write a letter of complaint.

Mary Pieta demanded to know why she was suspended and that she had resolved the little disagreement with the other patron and that the other patron apologized for causing a problem. Mary Pieta continued shouting at the librarian that she was there to write a letter of complaint and that DB was only doing this because she was too stupid to differentiate between disparaging remarks about a printer and disparaging remarks about a person.

Mary Pieta continued yelling and shouting at the librarian calling her stupid and approaching the librarian with a pointed finger. When DB asked Mary Pieta to please stop approaching her, Mary Pieta said that the librarian was afraid of words. The librarian then asked the library associate to please contact law enforcement because Mary Pieta was refusing to pack up her belongings and kept mumbling that she just needed to print this one thing out. The librarian again stated that unfortunately she is now suspended and would need to leave the library. When CS called 911 to ask for support, Mary Pieta began collecting her belongings and approached the librarian again in a very threatening manner and the librarian again asked her to please not approach any closer. Mary Pieta repeated that the librarian was stupid and believed all of the lies about her that other staff had poisoned her mind. She continued to argue that library staff was lying about her and that she was going to write a letter of complaint to get rid of DB for good. She then turned around and departed the library.

Ian said that he then called the girls “dumb sluts” and told them to leave repeatedly. Ian then said that Braley called him a racial slur regarding his BIPOC background. Ian then reported that he told Braley she looked like “Harry Potter’s autistic cousin”. Austin repeated the same story. SH then spoke with Braley and Noel and they said that the boys were calling them Mexicans and other names.

At 11:07 a women on Computer 12 screamed that it shut down and that she lost all her work and that she needed it back immediately. Staff informed her that once the computer logs off the memory is wiped clean and there would not be a way to recover her work if it was not saved elsewhere. Woman became hysterical that it should have given her a warning so VV decided to check MYPC and saw that computer 12 was still logged in. VV went to investigate the computer and saw that it said available and restarted the computer. VV explained that computers will shut off after one hour if not extended. Patron became agitated that she was not given the option to extend at any point during her session. VV stated that it is possible there was a glitch as this sometimes happens. Woman became paranoid that the glitch only affected her instead of the entire library. VV offered to right a report to IT to investigate the computer but assured that this was not an attempt to harm her but something that can happen to computers. 
Woman wanted to speak to manager about how unfair it was that she had to be personally attacked in this way. Manager was unavailable so In Charge staff CM came out to reiterate what VV had told her. Patron wanted business cards of the manager, CM and VV, a copy of  the tech report and mentioned she will be speaking to the director about this injustice. After giving all the information CM told patron there wasn't any thing more they could do. Patron then replied fine I will leave the premises.

JM informed LIII HT of the interaction, concerned that the patron was upset. 
At 12:27pm a patron called the branch. When LA MS answered, patron said ""May I speak with your manager?"" MS responded, ""May I ask who is calling?"" Patron responded, ""Like that matters! God damn. Fuck."" and hung up. MS then informed HT that she had received a call from an angry patron who swore and then hung up.
At 12:30pm, a call came in which MS identified as the same phone number. LI KVN answered the call. KVN said, ""Green Valley Library, this is Kelli, how can I help you?"" Patron responded in harsh tone, ""I want to speak to your manager."" KVN said ""Sure, can I ask what this is about?"" Patron said ""No, it's none of your fucking business. I need a manager."" KVN said, ""Okay, I am a manager and want to know how I can help you."" Patron said, ""Are you that bitch that sits over on the left side there? Because I'm not going to fucking talk to you. You were already horrible to me. I want the manager over everything. You're a fucking bitch."" KVN said ""Okay, you want the branch manager?"" Patron did not respond. KVN said ""Let me go see if she's available."" Patron did not respond. After checking to see if HT was available to take the call and letting her know the caller was very angry and cussing, KVN returned to the phone and said ""Okay, I'm going to transfer you now."" Patron did not respond. 
HT answered the transferred call from KVN and identified herself by name and title. She let the patron know that she would gladly speak with her but would not continue the call if the patron used profanity as she had in the previous two calls with library staff. The patron denied doing so and with voice rising said, “it [the computer] wouldn’t let me extend my time and I lost an important, time-sensitive document!” Based on this comment, HT surmised that the caller is the same patron as the previous call with MS and the in-person interaction with JM. The patron then said, “If I used profanity before, I’m sorry,” but that when she asked for help, the staff person told her to “save her work,” but “would not get off her fat ass” to help her. HT decided to overlook that comment and tried to ascertain the order of events and who the patron had asked for assistance. HT expressed regret that this had happened and confirmed what JM had told the patron at the Service Desk that there is not a way to get her work back. HT attempted to explain that items saved to a public computer are only saved as long as that user is logged in, and that the library loans flash drives so patrons can save their work externally as they go. The patron then said, “Go to hell!” and hung up.

On 10/5, one of our regular patrons, Todd, asked to speak with me (LA W.B.) privately in the library. Todd informed me that one of our regulars attacked him (on 10/3) and, I believe he said pushed him into a wall near the GLF bathroom which is outside in a breezeway (Todd described and pointed out which computer this patron was currently using so I could identify him, a man with blond hair in a pony tail named Jeremy). Todd said he attempted to file a restraining order at the GLF police substation and informed me he could not get one unless a 2nd incident occurred. He wanted to library staff know as he said he had talked to some of the staff the day of the incident. He did not wish to speak to the LIC. I let LIC V.G. know of the interaction, who later relayed the information to LIB II A.D. 
On 10/6 around 9:30 LTA SUP B.M. was arriving to pick up Friend's boxes and a patron in a car (BM described Todd, who is usually waiting outside the library long before we open) alerted him that another patron was urinating near library property in full sight of the parking lot and asked B.M. to do something about it. B.M. alerted library staff to the issue. Lib associate G.L walked the perimeter and found patrons Jeremy sitting behind the building. It was mentioned that some staff had heard of something happening between these two patrons sometime between 10-11 AM on 10/3 (and mentioned to staff later), but it appears any police activity was dealt with either at the substation or by calling 911, and library staff did not appear to be actively aware of an issue). 
For further documentation, Todd continued to alert staff on 10/6 shortly after we opened that someone had been bathing in the men's restroom and making a mess of water on the floor. Staff seemed to sense he was indicating it was the same patron, blond man with a ponytail (Jeremy) 
10/11/23: Patron Todd told LA W.B. around 1:30 on desk that patron Jeremy was ""washing his clothes"" outside by the patio. I explained that was not something we could deal with, but that I would check in with a librarian (LIB V.G. was on desk and overheard).

""Come on"" ""Jesus Fucking Christ"" and ""Fucking really?"" loudly enough that a teen browsing in Teen Fiction quickly left. KVN was unsure whether this behavior constituted a violation of the Code of Conduct so did not address it with the customer.
Periodically, over the course of two hours between 3:00pm and closing at 5:00pm, the customer used a hostile tone and made disparaging remarks about the staff and the library during interactions with five different staff members. For example, the customer told LTA JM that our staff/library had ""poor communication skills"" since the library hadn’t come up in her search results for public libraries in the area and no one had informed her that our wifi needed a password. JM told the customer the password while pointing to the sign on the wall behind him.
The customer returned a few minutes later to the service desk and told JM the wifi wasn't working and again denigrated our communication skills. JM explained that it might take a few moments for the popup window showing the computer use agreement to appear and that she would then be prompted to click ""I agree."" In a rude tone, the customer told JM that she's been around the country and never had to do this on other wifi networks. She used a similar tone when asking a page where she could find a nearby outlet to plug in her laptop. 
 
When doing her closing rounds, KVN approached the patron at approximately 4:56pm to give her a warning that the computer would automatically shut off at 5:00pm. The patron asked for help as she was having trouble printing. KVN went to the computer to assist at which time the patron told KVN that our system was so ""convoluted"" that she needed to print each page of her PDF document individually. KVN offered to help her print the whole document and the customer, in a harsh tone, exclaimed, ""No,"" and went on to say that she had had to sit at four different computers before she could find one that worked so she thought it was still 4:00pm. [It turns out she had attempted to use an adult guest pass on both a teen and a children’s computer; her complaint, though harshly delivered, was accurate—we do not have signs on the teen and children’s computers explaining that logging in requires teen/child library cards/guest passes—this will be remedied.]
KVN apologized for her experience and reiterated that the computer would automatically shut off in two minutes; KVN then let the customer know that the SAH library was open until 6:00pm. The patron snidely asked if KVN would reimburse her gas mileage and went on to comment that the whole staff here is incompetent, this is the worst library she has visited, and that no one communicates. She then added that staff are all civil servants who don’t care and don’t deserve to be paid. KVN listened and tried to apologize again for the woman’s experience, at which point the customer accused KVN of being insincere and “sadistic” since KVN “had a smile on [her] face.” On her way out, the customer told staff at the front desk (JM and two pages) that the whole time she was explaining her issues to KVN, KVN was smiling in amusement at her problems, taking joy in her pain, saying to them, “That is sadistic.” The customer also said that she would be ""filing a formal complaint"" about KVN and her experience here.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0106",0,2023-10-11,0-01-01 14:30:00,"14:30:00","02:30:00 PM","Joyner-Green Valley",0-01-01 14:00:00,"14:00-14:59"

LA CR goes to the lockers and notices that the locker box where the patron had his phone had a blue light, which means that it is an available locker. LA CR asks the patron if he had unlocked the locker before checking it again. LA CR explained that every time a phone is “retrieved” from the locker they must create a new pin if they want to leave it charging again. If not, the phone will remain in the locker but show as available. Unfortunately, the only people with security camera access were at lunch so LA CR asked if they wouldn't mind waiting a couple of minutes until someone came back to check the cameras.

This information was reported to both LIC LII JM and LTA NG. LIC LII JM walked towards children's area to enlist the help of Vet Sec guard JT, and Vet Sec guard I was also present at the time and the 3 of them headed towards the bathroom. At this time a patron named Sienna exited the bathroom and Vet Sec guard Jen and LIC LII spoke with her about what was happening inside. The patron, Sienna stated that the woman currently in the restroom started a fight with her verbally and was trying to touch her legs under the stall. The patron also reported that the woman had feces on her hands which was seen by Sienna as she reached under the other women's stall. The patron Sienna was asked to stay away from the patron in the restroom and not to fight her. Patron Sienna went to stand over by the express computers but was not using the computers. Vet Sec guard J knocked on the door and opened it slightly - loudly asking if the woman was okay, or if she needed any help, and told her that it was reported that she was fighting with someone in there. J then entered the bathroom and the patron used abusive language with her from the closed stall. Vet Sec guards J and I and LIC L2 JM waited for the patron to exit the restroom so that they could speak with her. LIC L2 proceeded to speak again with the Patron Sienna over by the express computers and she stated again that she was ready to fight patron still in the restroom because of what she had said from the restroom stall, things that didn't make sense to patron Sienna like, ""they're going to kill your children."" LIC L2 told the woman that fighting is not allowed in the library and it would be a 1 year suspension, and that she should not engage the woman anymore. Patron Sienna said that she did not know the patron in the restroom from anywhere else. Sienna continued standing at the computers and watching for the patron to come out. The Patron left the restroom after a few more minutes at 10:18am and walked quickly out of the library sliding front doors as Vet Set Guard Jen made a ""stop"" hand gesture to Sienna at the computers telling Sienna not to engage the patron, and the patron left the building without incident. At this point L3 LF arrived after being alerted by LIC L2 JM of the situation and L3 LF along with L2 JM spoke with Sienna further about the incident. After making sure that Sienna was calmed down, L3 LF and L2 JM proceeded into the entrance to children's and spoke with the patron who originally had reported the verbal fighting. This patron stated that she did not know either woman in the verbal altercation and when she heard them fighting she immediately left the restroom to tell library staff at the front desk what was happening.

The caregiver was on the computer ignoring 4 children, one who happened to be a three year old. One child was on the opposite side of the library, while the child pictured in gray was laughing at the child in blue and the youngest child punching each other and wresting on the floor in front of the hold shelf. These are behaviors that we have seen before and have attempted to control. LA KV approached the guardian and told her ""Excuse me ma'am, I'm sorry to interrupt, but the children cannot be punching each other and wrestling on floor"" she replied with ""okay"" and waved her hand to dismiss. LA KV walked away without her actually saying anything to the children, and they began running around in circles around the computers in the middle of the library, actively running into another patron multiple times. The patron that they were running into was sitting on a computer. After running into the patron they ran towards the middle of the library and were climbing on chairs and furniture. LA KV approached her again and stated that the children could not be running around the library, and that it was becoming disruptive for other people around. The guardian proceeded to state  ""they're not bothering anyone, I don't know what you want me to do. They're kids, you never have kids in here?"" LA KV proceeded to reply with ""The space is open to any patrons, but the behavior unfortunately is excessive and disruptive due to PCPL policy and we will have to ask you to leave if the behaviors continue."" At that point the patron replies with ""You can kick people out of the library for having kids?"" LA KV replied with ""no ma'am, we do not kick people out of the library for having kids, the behavior is disruptive and we have to make sure we follow county policy."" At that moment LA KV returned to the service desk. The children were still partially climbing on furniture. The patron came up to the service desk annoyed and aggravated. She started asking LA KV why LA KV would approach her and stated ""you can't say that they were wrestling and hitting each other, they weren't doing that"" LA KV attempted to explain to the patron the behaviors that I had observed, but every time LA KV attempted to get a word in, the guardian would interrupt and state ""You only target my kids, you've never told any other kids anything"" and was denying any of the behaviors that were observed. She requested to speak to LIC JM, and when LA KV went to get him for her, she discovered that LIC JM was on a call and was unavailable. LIC JM stated he needed 5 minutes and would be right out. LA KV came back out to let the patron know that LIC JM would come speak to her in 5 minutes, but found her attempting to be argumentative with LTA SUP JH, while he was attempting to explain liability and policy to the patron. LA KV let her know that LIC JM would be available in 5 minutes time. She continued to be argumentative with both LA KV and LTA SUP JH. At that point LA KV stated ""Ma'am I will need to ask you to please step outside and wait for the supervisor as the behavior is still disruptive."" She became even more upset and stated she wouldn't be kicked out of the library and demanded the phone number for the manager.

When I got there, one group of about 5-6 teens (Group B) had left the building, and another group of 3 teens (Group A) were sitting at a table in the teen area, looking through the window. L1MB was at the teen desk and told me that the two groups had been yelling at each other. I spoke to the teens in Group A, who said that ""everything was cool,"" and that they were fine, that there was no problem. I went downstairs and spoke with Guard JT, who was watching Group A who were sitting together in the plaza. We watched them for a while, identifying Ashley and another teen I recognized possibly as Manny. There were two or three others with them. One Guard JT recognized as being too old for the teen room (18yrs+). L1MB texted that Group A was talking amongst themselves that they were looking for a way out. I approached them again and asked if they were worried about leaving. They said, no, that they were ok, but they seemed frightened and worried to me. 
About a minute later, Group B returned and sat and stood outside the teen area. One of Group A, the girl, sprang up and started yelling and Group B. Everything then escalated quickly, in a matter of seconds. Kids were screaming and posturing to each other, swearing and out of control. Someone then started throwing books, and they began throwing books at each other. There were uninvolved patrons nearby, and the teens were near the balcony edge, but as far as I could tell, no books fell to the first floor or hit any bystanders. Guard IB tried to calm things down, but they were furious and beyond listening. L1MB called 911 from the teen desk. I ran upstairs to get L3MS, and we ran down together. L2KW was also calling 911 from the 2nd floor desk. The groups then ran down the stairs, Group B first. Group A followed, shouting to each other that there should be a back door. In the confusion downstairs, both groups were yelling. Group B left through the main doors and started toward the NE side of the building. Group A then tried to get out the emergency exit by the public computers, although we were yelling for them not to. They met Group B outside the door. Group A came back inside and then fled from the main doors.

He was in the room briefly as I was walking over and then the two of them headed into a different direction, into the teen area with their daughter. When I went into the room I immediately told the kids that was not okay for the man to enter the room and I asked them what he said. They told me he accused them of laughing and taking photos of the son, but they told him (and me) that they were laughing at something else and held up their phones saying they didn’t take any photos. Okay, I said, and you know that taking photos of other people in the library is not allowed, right? Yes, they said, and we had a conversation about wanting everyone to feel safe and welcome in the library. I told them if he comes in again (or something like that happens), please let library staff know. I repeated that what the man did was not okay and that I would speak to him. I then went over the couple and told them what I found out. The main said he knew they would deny it so that's why he went in to speak to them directly. I politely pointed out that his behavior was inappropriate, explaining he shouldn’t be going into a room or telling kids what they can or cannot do. If something like this happens again, please come up to the desk to let library staff know and we will follow up. He argued a bit, but seemed to understand and they left quietly shortly after I had returned to the desk. The kids in the room remained in the study room.

I explained to her that we had a conversation with both parties, explaining the rules of the library and it didn’t escalate to the point where we thought a police call was appropriate. I explained that if the man had gone in to talk to the kids again or something else happened, we would have issued a suspension at that point and/or followed up with other actions. She became verbally abusive to me, yelling into the phone, demanding that I go file a police report. After some time letting her speak, I asked her to please not yell at me. I repeated what I had said, stating that with incidents like this we try to educate customers about what’s allowed in the library and if they continue inappropriate behavior, we follow up.

He was expecting to meet with a woman at the library who was the subject of a “third-person report” to Adult Protective Services and might be in danger in her home. Chris said that he expected the woman to arrive alone, but there was a chance that the man would be with her and that, according to the person who made the report, the domestic partner owned a gun. Chris said he was in contact with the police about the situation.

L1 KB told guard BJ to stay in the lobby with Chris to wait for the woman. As a precaution, L1 KB unlatched the lobby gate so that it could be quickly closed, told guard BJ to be on alert but “don’t be a hero,” and told LA RG, who was on desk, to make sure she had her phone and the key to lock the gate readily available.

J and KW heard some mumblings from the group about beating up the person they were looking for, so KW tried unsuccessfully to engage with the group and ask what they were up to. KW followed the group downstairs and asked L3 LF who was at the first-floor desk to assist with engaging the teens. Tayana found the patron they were looking for in the first-floor women’s restroom. The patron came out willingly with Tayana and at Tayana’s request began to exit the library with the group. One of the boys in the group, Trey, turned out to be the patron’s boyfriend and warned the patron not to go outside because Tayana and Benny were going to beat her up. L3 LF asked the group “Are you searching the library with the intent of harming someone?” The group mostly ignored LF and proceeded outside, Tayana vaping while doing so. The patron stopped in the doorway without leaving and began asking the group who was now outside what the problem was. Tayana threw a series of threats at the patron and LTAS KW called 911 at 1:35 PM as they were openly threatening violence. The patron in the doorway yelled to the group of teens that the library would call the police on them, and this set Tayana off on another set of threats including how she would shoot L3 LF if she called the police. L3 LF was standing near the doorway encouraging the patron to disengage and come inside for her own safety. The woman stayed inside and repeatedly begged staff not the call the police as she was worried that she may have a warrant out for her arrest. LF told her police were on the way due to the actions of those outside and that while she didn’t have to stay, for her own safety we did not recommend she leave. LF offered to let her exit out of the back of the building which she declined. After a few minutes the group waiting in the plaza left, and the woman then settled in at a public computer.
 
 
Officers Wilson and Lee responded at 2:20 PM and took statements from L3 LF and LTAS KW.

He said that he was doing something on the computer and to leave him the fuck alone. I informed him that we cannot have him speak that way in the library. He continued to say leave me the fuck alone. A woman next to him asked him to stop. He continued to say leave me the fuck alone. I informed him because he continued to speak that way he needed to leave for the day. He again said leave me the fuck alone. I informed him because he would not leave, he was now trespassing. A man at another station interceded with ""you need to call the sheriff"". Jamie said ""call the police"". Jamie then said ""how I am supposed to leave if I am logged in smart guy"". I informed him that we can log him off. At this point Jamie started shouting at a man at the reference desk ""what the fuck do you want"". This man said ""you need to leave"". Jamie went straight up to him and started to posture. The other man stood his ground. I stood the side in between them and said you guys do not need to fight. I asked the man that was not involved that I did not need his involvement. I reiterated to Jamie that he needed to leave for the day. Jamie started to leave but stopped a quarter of the way to tell me in Spanish that he is of Sonora and to get the fuck out. He returned to English and began sizing me up and asking me what I was going to do. He said that is ""what I thought faggot"" and continued to leave. I reiterated we needed him to leave for the day. On his way out the door, he knocked over books that were on friends of the library cart and said something I could not make out. At this moment, the other man that had gotten involved reappeared in front of entryway. Jamie reengaged with this main and asked what the fuck did he want. The man stated that ""you need to not come back to the library"". I again told this man that I did not need his involvement. Jamie was now posturing again in front of him in a confrontational stance. This man again was standing his ground. Jamie said that he would come back with what sounded like AR-15 for him. I again reiterated that Jamie needed to leave. I saw Jamie follow his female companion that was on the other side of the courtyard. As I came back into library, the man that was engaging with Jamie asked if I was going to call the police. Two male patrons nearby chimed in with agreement. I called the police because of the disorderly conduct accompanied by threat with weapon. Deputy Sheriff responded in person later that hour. He interpreted the event as a disturbance and understood taking the threat with weapon seriously. He took down as much information I could provide on Jamie.

Security Guard VM checked the men's restroom and it had a strong odor of drug use. Video footage indicates that no patron besides Adrian has used the men's restroom for a half an hour before he entered. Security Guard VM reported that the odor was not present until after Adrian used the restroom. VM opens the restroom for each patron who needs to use it and is thus checking them frequently or in the vicinity of the restroom regularly. Between the last patron to use the men's restroom and Adrian using it, she was in the area of the restroom doors three different times to allow someone into the women's restroom. At those times VM didn't report noticing any strong odors associated with drug use. Based on this information, video footage, and past interactions with Adrian where substance use was in question, staff concluded that Adrian used the drugs causing the odor (despite also having reported their use).
When approached by LII JM and asked about the incident the patron denied using drugs in the library restroom and expressed being upset about being falsely accused and our policy that led to his suspension. He appeared under the influence of drugs to LII JM. After speaking with LII JM, LIII IR, and LSM ED-L (over the phone) about the incident, suspension, and how to appeal to library administration, Adrian left the library. 
Adrian has been a regular at the Valencia Library in recent months with large backpack and his small dog. He usually spends most of the computer lab. He is generally mild-mannered and polite with staff and other patrons. On one occasion he was asked to leave for the day because he smelled heavily of alcohol and was behaving as if under the influence.

After library hours he uses the north facing patio for electrical access to charge and use phones while drinking bottles of beer. The plastic bags and bottlecaps are left behind. The materials and littered trash behind the dumpster enclosure have increased in the last couple of weeks. There does not appear to be a mattress, however there are blankets, a banner being used as a tarp, many plastic bags, and empty bottles. The man was coming into the library daily for several hours, but his use has decreased since establishing the area behind the dumpster. Library Administration instructed to report the encampment via the COT survey, and that was done on 11/22/23 (R231122_1141_23104). There was no response, so it was recommended by PC Facilities to call the COT phone number (520-791-2540), and that was done on 12/5/23. They do have record of the report but said it takes a couple of days for the process to get going and typically takes weeks as they follow a specified tier process. It was explained that when someone eventually does come out, if they speak with the person, and all is peaceful, they will leave them as they are and offer optional resources. Library staff was instructed to call 911 if activity becomes criminal. Library Admin is following up further with PC security liaison and facilities.

Meanwhile, guard M had had previous interactions (all positive) with the man sitting in the Teen area so she felt comfortable asking him what had happened. The man said the guy has been following him and harassing him. Guard M told him if he had any issues with anyone in the library he needed to come to staff rather than start a fight. Meanwhile, I went and spoke to the man outside who said he had no idea who the man was, he just went to sit down and nodded ""hello"" to him and the man went off on him and threatened him. He apologized for his reaction. I said he was welcome back in but asked if he would find an area to sit that was far away from the other man and he was okay with that. I also asked him to let staff know if the man approached him rather than addressing things himself and he agreed. As of writing this (2:20pm) things have remained peaceful. Both men were given a verbal warning.

He was standing extremely close to the woman.  KS approached and interrupted, letting the man (Dale Winders) know that we had received a complaint about the behavior outside from a library user that they felt harassed. He mentioned that it was his right to express his opinion and KS agreed and said he could do so if he was not yelling or getting in people's faces. He said he would stay quiet then but continued to stand very close to the petition passer, and she started to move her things to get away from him.
A minute later Dale walked in front of the doors, KS who was talking to LA DM who was at the book lockers about what he witnessed, approached Dale again. She asked if he was planning to stay, he said ""yes"", so KS told him that he is welcome to stay and share his opinions; however, we had a policy and guidelines to follow, and she pointed out the two petition passing locations and asked him to stay at the one that was not occupied. (There are Petition Passing and Information Sharing guidelines out front in two locations.) She also mentioned that we ask people to check in at the desk and at that point Librarian II SYM brought both Petitioners the BOS policy.
Dale started reading the policy and then went and stood next to the other petition passer again. KS gave it a minute and he continued to stand near her, so she approached again and let him know that he needed to stay over at the unoccupied petition passing location or he would need to leave for the day. He said he would not. KS told him if he would not follow our polices that she would have to suspend him. He said, ""go ahead - you can't make me leave!"". KS told him that if he continued to stay that he would be considered ""trespassing"" and she would need to call the police and he said, ""go ahead!""
KS called the police. They talked to KS, DM, and the man. The man left. KS provided OVPD with his suspension letter, code of conduct, and policy. A senior police officer showed up and was arguing about our policies with the other junior officers stating that it is a ""first-amendment right and this was a public space""; KS told him that it is a 1st amendment right; however, it is still not okay to harass people while exercising that right and that the library can enforce our code of conduct/BOS policy. DM told them what he witnessed, which was the man yelling ""baby killers"" at people trying to sign the petition, and petition passer and trying to insert the photo he was holding in front of the clipboard while people were trying to sign.

LTAS KW spent 30 minutes talking with the patron about the price of printing, and the cases in which we make exceptions. As the conversation went in circles he made comments like ""Does your boss know you don't follow policy? What's their number?"" and ""I really don't want to get anyone in trouble, I just can't go all the way to my library today."" KW made it very clear that we would not give him hundreds of pages, and told him we would be happy to help him with anything else library related but KW and other staff can not continue to discus the price of printing. KW offered him the publicly available administration/LSM contact list which he declined saying he already has it. He then stood ten feet away from the desk and made a show of calling administration.

When she approached him about it he apologized, said he wasn't thinking, and took it outside. KN specifically told him, ""No alcohol in the library."" He was allowed to remain in the building at that point. At 3:50ish a teen came out of the teen area to say that the same person had another Twisted Tea and was drinking from it. The patron denied that the second can was his and said he took it from someone else but would not say who. AG told him that he had it in his hand, he needed to leave immediately, and he would be suspended. He apologized several times and asked for a second chance. AG told him he'd had a second chance already and he needed to go. He again pled to be allowed back in, said that his friends were inside, said that he would work for us to be allowed back. AG told him again that he needed to leave. He left, and about a minute later came back and asked to retrieve his phone. AG went with him to get his phone from the teen area. He didn't immediately find it and started demanding of the teens, ""Where the fuck is it? Which one of you motherfuckers took my phone?"" AG told him that language was not appropriate in the library, and he said, ""I really don't fucking care right now."" The teens in the area denied having anything to do with his phone, and soon one of them pointed out that it was sitting near a computer. He took his phone and again left. At about 4:10 library staff called for AG in the back again to say that he was back outside and was smoking in front of the building. AG got guard AB and they walked outside. As they walked other teens were coming inside giving directions to where he was, and two of them said that he was trying to fight with them. At that point he was at the far west front of the building. When he saw staff coming his way he began to run. Teens in the area denied knowing him. A few minutes later, one of the teens asked to speak to the manager. She told her side of the story, that this person had attempted to fight her sister when her sister was entering the library. She further stated that she had taken an audio-recording on her phone of Blake admitting to sneaking the Twisted Teas into the library for him, in exchange for 2 Monster energy drinks.

A longer suspension will be considered if this behavior continues.
On Thursday, 1/18, Senad was asked to leave the gaming program in the meeting room. From L1 AM : 
Senad was warned three times by me to keep his voice down (his friends too) watch his language and not slam his mouse when at the public computers during the 12 o’clock hour 1/18. I asked him his name and he said it was Jeremiah. I then told him and his friends that they could use the computers in the room when it opened. During the 2 o clock hour when I was there moderating he was warned not to cuss, slam his mouse and yell (Matias had warned him the previous hour). He smirked and said oh she keeps calling me Jeremiah and it’s not my name. Marisella told me his correct name. I gave him a final warning and told him he would have to leave the room if he couldn’t control himself. He then slammed the mouse down and I told him he had to leave the room since he wasn’t following the rules. He tried to come back in, I told him he wasn’t allowed to come back and he said but I just need to tell my friend something quick and still took a moment longer to tell his friend. He then went to the public computer area and was sulking the next hour when I came on desk.  
Today, 1/19, Senad came into the library with a friend(Taha) and asked for a guest pass. As he was talking he was hitting his ""friend"" in the legs with a stick. I told him to give me the stick because hitting people with sticks was not allowed in the library. He handed it over. I told Senad he had to use one of the computers near the teen area and not the ones by the art wall because he had already started to yell at the other kids he would be playing a game with. Later, as I walked past the computers, I reminded Marzella and Taha that there was no eating allowed at the computers and to put away their food. Senad jumped up from his computer and snatched the pizza out of Taha's hand. Taha did not immediately say anything about this, so I told Senad not to eat the pizza at the computer. But then he sat at his computer and started eating the pizza. I told Senad again that there was no eating at the computers, so he shoved the last of it in his mouth and stuffed the box under his bottom. Then Taha said, ""he also stole that pizza from me."" I verified with Taha that he was not joking, and he was in fact upset. I stood next to Senad and listed the things he had done today that were against the rules. I told him I was feeling generous but he was on his absolute last warning and if I had to come over again he was out for the day. I returned to the desk, but Taha came to the desk a few minutes later to say that Senad was cussing. I went back to the computers and told Senad that he was done for the day. He left without complaint, but once I was off desk, he returned three separate times. L1 HT informed him over and over that he was suspended for the day. She told him she would get the manager and he did not try to return again that hour. 
I looked up his library card and found a phone number for his father. I called and listed Senad's infractions to his father. His father indicated that he understood (though I am not certain as English is not his first language) and said he would come by to pick up Senad. He did not come into the library though.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0119",0,2024-01-19,0-01-01 12:42:00,"12:42:00","12:42:00 PM","Dusenberry-River",0-01-01 12:00:00,"12:00-12:59"

This caused the patron to feel unsafe and that the officer had interfered with her personal space and privacy by messing with her USB. LHN tried reassuring her that officer NL was doing his normal walk around and helping to keep the library tidy by pushing in chairs. The patron said that she couldn’t see him fully, but he was lingering and not just pushing in the chairs even if that's what LHN thought. Patron stated that all she could see was that he was by the computer and had kept watching her and he was messing with her things. Officer said, “He was not touching her things but moving the chair because it was tilted upright.” and moved away from her belongings.

He left abruptly out the front door while the desk person got LIC BL. I spoke with the woman to learn what happened and said we would speak to him about his behavior if he came back in. She felt unsafe and wanted someone to walk her to her vehicle, which I did. John was out there near his vehicle drinking a bottle of water. He didn't approach us or say anything. I came back and noticed the front door wasn't working correctly and tried to fix it, when he approached. He came in to get more water and I asked if he was the man that went into Study Room B. He said yes, but that he thought she was someone else. If that happened again I asked him to speak to staff at the desk for assistance rather than entering another room. He said okay and walked away, back to Study Room C. I got a Code of Conduct, highlighted a portion, and asked another In-Charge person to watch me approach his room for a more formal verbal warning. I explained that we want everyone to feel safe in the library, showed him the Code of Conduct, and calmly explained that if he exhibited that kind of threatening behavior again, we would need to ask him to leave the library.

In June, Librarian III KS talked to him about the library and how to check out books. He did get a library card the next time he came in the library. He only checked a few books out a couple times and would immediately put them in the exterior book drop after leaving.
From June - November 2023, staff would witness some odd behavior. He always walks into the library facing away from staff and take the longest route around the edge of the room quickly. Usually with a ballcap and/or hoodie up. Staff saw him one night in late November with stacks of Graphic Novels, going to back and forth to his backpack that he left in the nonfiction section behind a bench. He did not check anything out and then the stack of graphic novels could not be found.  The next day he came in and Librarian III KS asked him to come to the desk where it was quiet. KS said “Hey, Andy - Staff saw you with a large stack of Graphic Novels but didn’t see you check them out last night.” He immediately jumped in and claimed he put them back. KS told him to please put them on the cart by the front desk for our statistics and so we can make sure they are counted and put back in the correct place. KS let him know that what staff had witnessed him doing could make people suspicious that he was stealing, and we wouldn't want people thinking that if it wasn't the case. He did not come back for several months until 2/7.
On 2/7 staff said he didn't have his backpack this time, but they believe that he tucked something under his puffy jacket. He wanted to check out something for his mom, but they weren't linked so he called her and she came inside from the car to check out her own items. 
On 2/8 around 4:10pm, Librarian III KS saw him come in and asked if LA LG could help her watch him, so it was less obvious. LG watched him go from Adult to Teen Graphic novels and he took pictures of the ISBNs of the books. KS also witnessed him seemingly taking photos of the books at one point while walking by. He went back and forth a couple times and eventually LG saw him put four “Teen” graphic novels under his oversized jacket - he sat on the floor with the books on the ground next to him and slid them up his side under his jacket. KS saw him walk by with graphic novels under his jacket. He went very quickly to the restroom with his left arm glued to his side and his phone in his left hand. KS followed him the entire way after seeing the books in his jacket, and he did not stop anywhere else in the library. (While in the restroom, KS and LG discussed what they saw and when LG told KS she saw him put “4 Graphic Novels under his jacket”, which was consistent with what KS noticed under his armpit in his jacket.)
Andrew came out of the restroom and the books were no longer under the armpits of his jacket and he was no longer holding his arm to his side.  LG checked everywhere in the restroom, even the garbage, and the books were not there. He waited for staff to change at 5pm and left with his mother; he called her after going to the restroom and she came in to get her book from the hold shelf and then rather than leaving they loitered in the Friends Shoppe and hallway from 4:35-4:45. At 4:45 she went and talked to the AARP tax people at one point until they left at 5:03pm. 
While we cannot be certain, staff believe he put the books in the lining of his large jacket at the back based on the way it looked after he came out of the restroom. 
 
When they left at 5:03PM, KS followed outside and asked “Hey, Andy! Was there anything you need to check out?” The mother had walked away. He said “no”. KS let him know that we saw him go into the bathroom with several books under his coat. He opened his coat showing KS the front of his shirt saying they weren’t under there. KS said, what happened to the books then? He said he put them back on the shelf, and KS said “Oh, that’s odd because we didn’t see you do that.” SYM was watching a few feet away told him that he needed to return what he didn’t want at the desk next time if took them off the shelf, and KS let him know that if he is stealing books that the suspension is one year from all library locations – holding up a suspension letter KS had prepared for him. He said “okay. I didn’t steal” and left.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0033",1,2024-02-08,0-01-01 17:03:00,"17:03:00","05:03:00 PM","Oro Valley",0-01-01 17:00:00,"17:00-17:59"

LSM VL 2/14/24 UPDATE: This may be a case of mistaken identity. Some SRO staff and the guard MM, familiar with Tony Burgis, do not believe this is the same Tony.
STU, where the other Tony frequents,  was notified of the possible mistake and we all will be sure that the patron is welcomed into the library.  Unfortunately the staff and guard familiar with the ""bad"" Tony were not present during the interaction I had and I believed it to be the ""bad"" Tony.  Due to the last incident by the school, where ""bad Tony"" was violent and caused a trail of blood from himself or someone else all along the school sidewalk to the park, I was being overly cautious.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0041",0,2024-02-13,0-01-01 14:15:00,"14:15:00","02:15:00 PM","Santa Rosa",0-01-01 14:00:00,"14:00-14:59"

At various times, members of staff have advised the two groups to keep apart. On 2/15/24 at 3:45pm, regular tween patron Alice came to L1 EG and said that another tween had called her friend, Braedon (in our game room), “the n-word.” Upon speaking with the group of tweens standing outside the game room, EG determined that the word had been used by a newer tween patron, Cayden. EG asked Cayden to please call his parents, as he would have to leave for the day due to his use of abusive language. She then addressed the remainder of the group, reminding them that their negative behavior was escalating, and in the future they could face consequences up to and including suspension if they continued on this path.
EG went to speak with the second group of tweens to explain the consequences and potential suspension of the continued escalation. While speaking with this group, EG discovered that Cayden had tried to enter the game room, and Braeden had blocked the door. Cayden then used the n-word and slapped Braeden. In response, Braeden had kicked Cayden and “taken a swing” at him. Realizing that the interactions had turned physical, EG went to speak with L3 BL, who determined they should sit down with both boys. BL highlighted relevant sections of the code of conduct. She then asked each of them what had happened. Each told their side of the story, and it was discovered that there had been a miscommunication about who was allowed in the room. Each had responded in anger toward the other. BL explained that the library is supposed to be a safe space for everyone, and using abusive language and engaging in violent acts runs contrary to our goals. She further explained that this sort of behavior can lead to suspensions. Both boys admitted to their part in the altercation. Each sincerely apologized to the other. They both agreed to take more control over their responses, and to seek staff when they feel disrespected or unsafe. As both boys understood the consequences, it was decided that this would serve as a verbal warning and they would not be suspended at this time. Staff will continue to monitor their behavior. Both boys expressed they would like to continue to use the library, and admitted that a suspension was not their desired outcome.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0122",0,2024-02-15,0-01-01 15:45:00,"15:45:00","03:45:00 PM","Sahuarita",0-01-01 15:00:00,"15:00-15:59"

She asked for a place to charge her phone. Librarian IR brought a water bottle and showed her how to use the charging tower. Fawn insisted that the charging tower cubby be left unlocked while the phone charged. Fawn continued pacing and commented that she was feeling overheated. She also requested a book about astrology. Lib. IR walked her over to find the book and when they both got back to the phone tower, the phone was gone. IR indicated that she could call 911 and submit a theft report. 
Fawn became more agitated and began screaming at IR and insisting that the police be called. Fawn was pacing more erratically around the library, yelling and cussing. At the entrance she paced around the security officer and in her rush hit him with her body. She apologized, but continued pacing.
This particular part of the incident continued in this manner for about 10 minutes inside and outside of the library.
By the time TPD arrived, Fawn had calmed down and had been using the computer. Just before TPD entered the building to receive the incident report, staff at the front desk reported that Fawn took out a taser from her backpack and was discharging it several times. Staff reported feeling intimidated and they noticed that Fawn was laughing in seeming delight at causing her service dog to act fearful with the zapping of the taser nearby. Fawn Pape put the taser away and brough out a baton showing off the weapon to her friend before putting it away before the officers walked up to them.

LII AD went and spoke with him. They said ""excuse me"" several times, until Jeremy looked at them, and then they informed him that there had been several complaints about the noise level, and asked him to keep it down. He never verbally acknowledged AD, but he remained quiet throughout the interaction. LII AD then came away and updated LTA DM and LTA Sup SG about the situation.
Approx. 1:55pm, a patron approached LII AD to complain that Jeremy's volume was again high, and he was making statements that were making her uncomfortable. She specified that he had been talking about ""sex changes"" and making statements like ""you can't arrest those kinds of Mexicans and Blacks"" and ""if I wanted to fuck your niece..."". She said that a couple of families had left the area because of him. At 2pm, LII AD informed LIII AL of the ongoing situation, and accompanied AL to again speak with Jeremy. AL asked Jeremy to leave for the day and explained the complaints and the inappropriate statements and language. Jeremy complied with the request to leave, but made several more bizarre and alarming statements, including describing AL as ""German"", claiming she was ""pushing drugs"" and ""should go see someone about that"", misogynistic statements about ""women and men"", and making several references to being part of the mafia (seemingly because AL had mentioned families), and discussing ""children with AK-47s"" at length. Jeremy also either could not or would not answer the question of whether he was aware he'd been making statements aloud, even when AL asked several times.
Jeremy's conspiratorial/misogynistic/racist statements have consistently been a problem in recent weeks that have required staff intervention.
UPDATE: Some of the incidents involving Jeremy over the past several weeks are as follows:
12/1/23: Patron complaint of Jeremy cursing loudly on the computer.
12/15/23: Patron complaint of Jeremy cursing loudly in the computer lab. Patron specifically noted that Jeremy's behavior was a recurring issue.
1/4/24: Jeremy was overheard by staff cursing loudly in the computer lab. LA WB asked Jeremy to lower his volume. Jeremy glared at WB and denied wrongdoing.
1/29/24: Jeremy was overheard by staff having ""a loud, acrimonious conversation on his headset"". Librarian SM asked him to lower his volume. He became defensive and rude but took a walk and returned calmer.
2/5/24: LTA MB requested assistance from Librarian II AD to have a conversation with Jeremy about his volume. MB informed Jeremy that he needed to lower his volume while in a quiet space like the computer lab. Jeremy responded with several conspiratorial statements, and kept returning to the theme that ""as women"", LII AD and LTA MB were at risk of violence. It was not directly threatening, but it was bizarre and unsettling. LTA MB repeatedly asked if Jeremy understood that he needed to lower his volume, and he eventually agreed.
2/8/24: While in the computer lab, LTA MB overheard Jeremy say loudly ""Yeah and she'll go home and take 10 Black guys up the ass"". LTA MB was unable to address this behavior because they were assisting two other patrons, but alerted LTA Sup SG to it later.
2/26/24: Jeremy entered the library and immediately greeted Librarian SM by saying ""I forgive you!"" with a wide grin, apropos of nothing. SM replied ""Great! I wasn't aware I needed any."" She found it a bizarre thing to say.
In addition to these specific moments, most days, Jeremy requires a staff reminder about his volume level.
UPDATE 2/28: After consulting with LSM VL, it was decided to suspend Jeremy for a year. Approx. 11am, upon Jeremy's arrival, LII AD called the non-emergency line for assistance in suspending Jeremy and escorting him from the property. Officer J Davis (Badge #47230) arrived at approx. 1:25. He gave Jeremy the suspension letter. Jeremy asked if the suspension was from all libraries and the officer replied ""Yes, all libraries in Pima County."" Officer Davis also explained that Jeremy could appeal the suspension in writing. Jeremy ranted about ""protection by exclusion"" and ""protection from a gangbang"" and other such statements. Officer Davis allowed Jeremy to retrieve his belongings and then escorted Jeremy off the property.","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0047",1,2024-02-27,0-01-01 13:30:00,"13:30:00","01:30:00 PM","Miller-Golf Links",0-01-01 13:00:00,"13:00-13:59"

During an internal patrol LTA sup MB observed a teen sitting on the back of a couch and reminded them to sit correctly. The group's volume continued to build over the hour, both in voice level and horse-play behavior, despite repeated reminders and warnings from staff.
From the desk LTA sup MB observed tween patron Michael chasing tween patron Rachel along the glass wall in the teen area, catching up to her out of view of staff. Rachel immediately ran over to LTA sup MB and LTA GP at the front desk and reported that Michael had whipped her with his phone charging cord on her arm and leg, pointing to a visible red mark on her arm. LTA GP retrieved in charge LI KN from the staff area. LI KN spoke with Rachel who described the incident again, as well as openly admitting that she and Michael had been rough-housing and that she had been goading him into hitting her. KN let Rachael know that Michael would be asked to leave for the day for hitting her with the cord, but also advised her to consider her actions and words and how they can affect herself and others in the future.
LI KN went to the teen area and asked Michael to gather his belongs and come speak with her outside the teen area. As Rachel entered the teen area behind LI KN, she gave Michael the middle finger. Michael (and others) complained about the action, which KN told Rachel she would address with her after speaking with Michael. Michael slowly gathered his belongings, stalling by asking a friend if he would watch his portable stereo and looking for his phone cord. During this time LI KN explained the events to L2 DT and asked her to address Rachel's actions and ask her to leave for the day for giving the middle finger behind LI KN's back. Michael finally exited the teen area. LI KN started to speak to Michael outside the teen area, but he requested that they speak in one of the study rooms for privacy so ""the entire library wasn't staring at me"". LI KN agreed and stepped into the study room. LI KN explained that because he had hit someone and left a mark he was being asked to leave for the day, but because there had been some back-and-forth between him and Rachel leading up to the incident he was not going to be suspended for any longer. Michael continually talked over KN as she tried to explain, saying Rachel ""had got kids suspended at school"" and accusing staff of not listening to him. LI asked Michael to give her a chance to explain but he continued to speak over her, so she asked him to leave and that the two of them would try to have the conversation another day. Michael insisted he was listening, but when LI KN tried again to explain he began to speak over her again, this time arguing that ""in a court of law"" Rachel would be ""convicted"". LI KN stated that this isn't a court of law so they wouldn't be discussing that. Since he still refused to listen and stop speaking over LI KN she told him he needed to leave for the day and that they'd try again tomorrow.

LA ES called library admin to report this issue. Upon viewing the security footage, the unknown patron from incident report 0000023143 can be seen throwing rocks first through an east side door and then through the north side door and a window on the east side of the building, breaking the glass of each. He is already suspended from Pima County Libraries.
On 03/21/24 the patron came in around 3:45, for our safety the staff did not engage with the patron given the gravity of his actions. LA CR called 911 around 3:50 and let them know that the patron was trespassing. Before LA CR ended the call, the patron made his way out of the library. There was no follow up from the police. 
03/22/24- Ruben came back into the library around 4:10 LA CR and L1 MG reminded the patron about his suspension and left right away. 
3/25/24- Ruben came into the library around 10:23, and VetSec MM informed him that he was suspended and unable to enter any Pima County Library property. VetSec MM and LSM VL ensured he left the area. He came back around 11:53 and poked his head into the door to ask if his sister Cassandra had left the library. Library staff told him that he was suspended and could not enter library property. Library staff is unaware of any associates and have not seen him with any other patrons.
3/26/24- At 10:07 Ruben was approaching library property when VetSec MM identified him as a suspended patron and reminded him that he is not allowed in the library. Ruben then pulled out two shards of green glass. He then began to walk on the north side of the library near the Head Start facility. VetSec MM returned to the library to make staff aware of the events. As LA CR called 911, VetSec MM witnessed Ruben attempt to enter the nearby school Drachman Montessori. The library was instructed by police to go into lockdown and the Head Start facility and Drachman were instructed to do the same. Police responded at 10:22. They spoke with Ruben. Due to not having video or direct witnesses from the window vandalism incident, the police released Ruben.

He will seek her out in lieu of other staff, he often tells her “You’re my favorite,” and he has looked at her in a way that makes her feel objectified. His behavior, though uncomfortable, did not rise to the level of harassment until 3/12/24 at about 5:15PM, when John walked up to EG on the desk and said, “you drive a stick shift?” EG answered in the affirmative and he said, “I knew that about you.” As manual transmissions are rare, and EG doesn’t advertise the fact that she drives one, EG felt that John not only knew which vehicle was hers but had also looked in her windows to confirm that she did, in fact, drive a stick shift. EG felt threatened by the idea that John knew her vehicle and personal details and told LIII BL about the interaction. BL determined that John’s behavior was threatening, and this interaction could be seen as harassment.
After talking with staff at GVY and due to a pattern of incidents after a verbal warning, we decided to suspend him for one week. LIII BL asked to speak to him away from other customers and brought up the conversation about the car, telling him that this made the employee feel watched and unsettled. I referenced the other incidents, letting him know he was increasingly making staff and patrons uncomfortable. Since I'd already given him a verbal warning, we were suspending him for one week and that included all libraries, including those in Tucson and Green Valley. I told him he could return on 3/20/24 and showed him the portion about appeals. He asked me why he's suspended from the libraries in Tucson if he made someone in SAH uncomfortable. I told him this type of behavior isn't acceptable at any location and suspensions are enforced at all locations. I could hear him mumbling under his breath about where he might find a computer to use. He seemed to understand my words, but not the emotional impact of his behavior. We've heard this might be due to a brain injury, but wanted to make it clear that this behavior needs to stop if we wants to continue using the library.

The patron was concerningly under the influence and was nodding out in place and listing side to side. His speech was extremely slow and slurred. He requested a computer pass and headphones which he received from library staff. He then attempted to make his way over to the computer room, and appeared to be having difficulty moving and navigating.

L1 MD and LA RS each approached to check on the patron, and offered to call for medical attention as we were extremely concerned for his safety. He declined each time assistance was offered. At this time, El Rio Neighborhood Center manager PP entered the library (unrelated to the incident), and upon being briefed on the situation by library staff stated that per City of Tucson regulations, this level of intoxication would warrant removal from the premises but he defers to PCPL/County procedure. L1 MD called 911 but emergency personnel stated that unless the patron consented to medical attention, they legally could not send help. LA RS called the In-Charge number at the Main Library and was advised to contact the Crisis Line. L1 MD called the Crisis Line and they confirmed that this behavior sounded like the patron was under the influence of opioids. A response team was dispatched with an unknown ETA. In the meantime, the patron continued cycling through the ""nodded out"" and hectic movements. LA RS and L1 MD kept an eye on the patron, occasionally approaching to check on him.

LTA Supervisor SS told the group they could contact Library Administration, their response was “Library administration could call us.”
LTA Supervisor SS and LI RW then made in charge L1 BT aware of the situation. LI BT approached the group reiterating and citing the BOS Policy D 32.11. L1 BT also gave the group contact information for Library Administration. The group continued to argue and ask questions, LI BT repeatedly told them to contact library administrators for questions/concerns.

He wanted in-charge staff to be aware since this situation has caused friction in the past.
Approx. 10:20am, a woman from the pro-life table came up to LA KK to ask about boundaries. She complained that people from the pro-choice table were approaching patrons and blocking them from approaching her pro-life table. LII AD came out and spoke with both groups, asking them to stay in the general area of their tables. Both groups agreed.
Approx. 10:30am, the same woman from the pro-life table returned to the library, complaining that the folks at the pro-choice table were still exiting their designated area and coming too far into her space. She further stated that one of the men from the pro-choice table had approached her table and ""gotten in her face and yelled at her"". LII AD printed both the petition passing policy and the code of conduct (a copy for each group). AD handed the woman her copy of the documents and discussed the contents with her, and let her know that AD would be observing so that they could address any specific behaviors. LII AD and LA WB went outside and observed both tables from the breezeway. After a few minutes, the same woman approached, again complaining that earlier that morning, the man from the pro-choice table had yelled at her. AD let her know that the man would be told to interact respectfully.
LII AD and LA WB then went over to the pro-choice table, handing them the petition passing policy and code of conduct. AD then clarified for both groups that the area between the prickly pear fruit statue and the beanpod statue must be kept clear for patrons to walk, including the entire breezeway into the library. AD further instructed both groups that they must stay in the vicinity of their tables, because tables must be attended at all times, per the petition passing policy. AD explained that patrons needed to be free to walk unimpeded and that the library wanted both groups to have an equal chance to share their information peacefully. Again both groups agreed.

They were informed by LII IC JM that they could pick up their suspension paperwork at the guard station on the 1st floor, but that they were not going to be shown the photos captured from library cameras. Vet Sec Guard D stayed on the second floor and LII IC JM escorted the boys downstairs to the guard station. Vet Sec Guard JT gave three of the boys their suspension letters. The boys again argued about wanting to see the photos from the previous days incident and they began using abusive language towards Vet Sec Guard A, and also Vet Sec Guard D who was up on the 2nd floor balcony. Several of the boys were taunting Vet Sec Guard D by calling him a “nigger” and trying to get him to come down to the first floor to fight.

Vet Sec Guard JT calls the police to report that two 3 of the youth were just served their paperwork, and were not exiting the library as they had been asked to do by staff and guards, and that they were trying to start fights with the two of the Vet Sec Guards and another teen, E.

He had been using the library for roughly 2 weeks without incident.
At around 2:35pm (while guard was on break) desk staff entered the back room and requested the in-charge person, stating two men were about to fight. LIB 2 KVN went into the library where Sean #2 was yelling profanities at a male computer user (Phillip) and 2 female computer users. Sean had moved toward the lobby area of the library when KVN approached and asked him to leave. Sean #2 acknowledged the request by saying ""okay ma'am"" and continued to encourage Phil to step outside to ""fight him"" while calling the female patrons the n-word and other slurs. KVN stepped in front of him to block his line of sight and told him to leave immediately. Sean #2 used his arms to push past KVN without touching her and continued to move closer to the other patrons, escalating his voice and threats. He repeatedly told Phil to fight him outside, while telling the female patrons to ""shut up."" KVN continued to move in front of him and body-block him from getting to the patrons inside the library, and finally had to raise her voice and say ""Outside now."" At that point Sean #2 complied and walked outside.
Once Sean #2 left the building (while continuing to yell and say abusive slurs and profanities) KVN asked other staff to grab LIB 3 KW while talking to the other patrons. Phil and 2 female patrons stated that Sean #2 had been at the computers when he started to escalate and make threats toward the female patrons, accusing them of spying on his computer or interfering with his use of the library. Phil stepped in and told him to calm down, which escalated Sean #2 into the fight with all 3 patrons. KVN asked if all 3 patrons were okay staying in the building while the situation was managed, and they agreed.
Sean #2 was sitting on the edge of the library parking lot, so KVN and KW consulted on what to do. KW went outside to help a patron and Sean #2 left the property, appearing to want to avoid confrontation with KW.
Roughly 10min later, staff entered the back room saying other patrons were reporting 2 males fighting in the parking lot. KW went outside with KVN as back-up, and found Sean #2 and Phil ending a verbal altercation in the Golden Corral parking lot after chasing each other, with Sean #2 attempting to re-enter library property. KVN stayed with Phil and directed him to walk with her back inside. Phil claimed he had stepped outside for a smoke break and to ""make sure it was safe for his wife and service dogs to leave"" when Sean #2 attempted to attack him. Phil ran from him and reported that Sean #2 never made physical contact with him. 
While KVN walked Phil inside, KW instructed Sean #2 to leave the library property and informed him that he is suspended for 1 year for fighting and abusive language. KW had attempted to call 9-1-1, but the connection outside failed. Sean #2 continued to follow KVN and Phil until they turned west on 22nd street to return to the library.

It was a confusing conversation with DB trying to get to the bottom of what happened. The kids kept arguing while talking to DB and then concluded that everything was okay, and they didn’t want to file a complaint anymore. In-charge LTA Supervisor RM had heard this interaction with the three kids at the front desk while passing through. It was a busy time of day, so they forgot about the weird conversation until Page MZ brought a wallet she found in the teen section to the front desk. MZ and DB looked for an ID in the wallet and discovered it belonged to a minor. DB had just put the wallet in the locked box when the mother of the wallet's owner called the library. DB answered and the caller said that her son had lost his wallet and she wanted to know if we had found it in the library. DB told the mother we had found a wallet and asked her what her son’s name was. The caller said the correct name of the wallet's owner, so DB told her she could pick it up with a photo ID at the front desk. The mother asked if his dad could pick it up and gave us the dad’s name. The dad came in with his ID and picked up the wallet. RM verified the dad's ID had the right name and then asked him to sign our lost and found log that he received the item. After the dad left with the wallet, the same kids showed up at the desk and the kid who wanted to file a complaint said that his friend Emiliano took the money from the guy’s wallet. Emiliano told RM he had taken the money because he found the wallet. RM was confused because the conversation with them earlier was that Emiliano stole the money from his friend. RM asked the friend if that wallet was his and he said no. RM did not know how to handle the situation from there and told the kids that it was wrong to take the money from a wallet and that the next time you find a lost wallet do not take anything out of it and turn it in at the front desk. On April 9th, RM relayed the situation that occurred the day before to Branch Manager BL. BL noticed Emiliano had reserved a study room when he arrived in the afternoon. BL asked if she could speak to him. He said, Is this about the wallet? BL said, ""Yes, can you tell me what happened yesterday?"" He admitted quickly that he took $15 from a wallet he found on the table in the newspaper room, leaving the wallet there. BL discussed other choices he could have made at that moment. He offered to give the money back, stating that he didn’t spend it because he “knew you were going to ask for it back.” BL replied that if he gave back the money that would lessen the amount of time of suspension and showed him the Code of Conduct, explaining more about suspensions/behaviors/consequences.

He had a bandana covering his face. Children’s Librarian EG discussed the parameters of filming within the library, letting him know that he wasn’t allowed to film other customers and asked him to be careful of that since there were people moving around the space. She also alerted Branch Manager BL. I came out and asked if I could help him with anything and he said, “So, this is a public space. I know I can film staff. Can I film you then?” while holding up his phone towards me. I said well, not right now because there might be customers coming in the front door behind me and you can’t film customers for privacy reasons. He began arguing about public spaces, saying no one had privacy in a public space. I tried to explain customers still have privacy rights and I gave him a copy of the code of conduct, pointing out the portion about filming, but he didn’t want copies of the statute. He said he was just filming information about the library then moved his phone across all of our flyers and handouts. I said okay, that’s fine and walked away, back over to the desk. He then followed me while holding his camera facing me and said, “Can you tell me about library services?” I asked which ones and he said all of them. I shared basic information check-outs, computers, digital options, and noticed he was getting bored and looking around. I took the opportunity to walk into the staff area and continued to watch him on the cameras. He left the desk area and wandered around the building for over an hour filming every possible paper, sign, and flyer, but seemed to be avoiding people. I was then scheduled on the desk and he came up to ask for my business card, which I gave him. He continued filming in the lobby. At one point a customer came in the door. She seemed to try to avoid him, but it looked like he might have caught her on camera as she made her way through the second set of doors. He then made eye contact with me through the glass, staring, almost defiantly as if wanting me to go confront him. The customer had since started talking with another desk person about getting a card. As I was deciding what to do, other customers came up to the desk needing help. At some point he wandered out of the building. Later in the afternoon, the same gentleman called the branch. Staff transferred the call to Branch Manager BL. I introduced myself and said, how can I help you with your question? He replied that I couldn't since I had been the person he spoke with earlier. Then he hung up.

The man had an orange bottle of Listerine in his hand and drank from the bottle at least once. Larry said that he “didn’t want to live” and that he was going to kill himself or harm others and insisted that he was not homeless. LA MA called 911 from the circulation desk phone and was eventually connected to NAMI crisis. LA MA was told that several people from crisis were on the way but that there was no estimated time of arrival. LII IC JM asked Larry if ""he was okay"", or if there was an issue we could help him with, needed assistance or if we could call anyone for him. It became immediately apparent that Larry was in crisis and Vet Sec Guard JT joined the group interacting with Larry and he asked if there was somewhere he could sit down. JM pointed out a bench by the front doors, but Larry instead sat down behind the guard station at a table in between the two doors. Larry explained that he had come from La Frontera (behavioral health) that morning and that he was upset with an employee there and wanted to kill them. LII IC JM told the patron that she was ""sorry that this had happened to him"" and suggested that we call the crisis line so that he could explain more about his situation to them and get some help. The patron stated that if we make him go outside, he would ""murder the first person"" he saw. The two Vet Sec guards continued trying to keep the patron calm and listening to him talk and Vet Sec guard JT retrieved a bottle of water for the patron. LII IC JM called Mental Health TPD from the IC phone and the dispatcher offered to stay on the phone and to connect her with TPD which took a few minutes. JM confirmed the description of the patron to TPD and the dispatcher stated that police would come as soon as they were available, but that they were having a busy afternoon, and they could not give an estimated time of arrival and said to call back if anything escalated. An employee from Sonora Behavioral Health who happened to be meeting with JM then joined the group interacting with Larry. Larry became more animated as the employee from Sonora Behavioral Health tried to talk with him, throwing his hands up in the air as he spoke loudly repeating the same things reported above. At this point the Vet Sec Guards stepped back and began guiding patrons to go around the 30-minute computer area to continue into the library. The group continued to talk to Larry until he got up from the chair and went outside the sliding glass doors on his own. The employee from Sonora behavioral health walked with him outside to continue talking and Vet Sec guards D and JT stood inside the sliding glass doorway to observe and help guide patrons to the other door that leads down to the parking garage in order to keep the area as clear as possible. The patron came back inside the building on his own and sat down in the chair again and began to threaten to ""come back to the library with a molotov cocktail."" The outreach worker from Sonora Behavioral Health called La Frontera from his cell phone and put them on speaker phone so that the patron could talk to them about the issue he was having and try to resolve it and he was able to get some information from Larry such as his name and birthdate. The patron stated that no one was going to come because they didn’t care. Larry began hitting his head against the wall and hitting the wall behind him with his fists. He stated again that he wanted to die. LIII M approached Larry and asked that he stop hitting the wall with his fists. Larry got up from the chair and walked outside on his own again and leaned against the pillar outside by the planters and then began to bang his head on the pillar. LI IC AW called back TPD and informed them that Larry was attempting to injure himself by banging his head against the concrete pillar. The NAMI crisis mobile team called the IC phone and told LI IC AW that they were having issues finding parking in the library parking garage and they were asked to move their car. They said they would be there as soon as they were parked. A TPD vehicle responded first and drove onto the plaza at around 12:30pm. At this point Larry had laid down on the ground outside like he was pretending to be asleep. An officer came over to talk to the patron and he was joined by two other officers on bikes. Larry continued talking to the officers using the same language about harming himself or others. The employee from Sonora Behavioral Health helped to inform officers of the detailed he had gathered from Larry and La Frontera. The officers asked that Larry put his hands behind his back and helped him off the ground. An officer said that they were going to get him ""some help"" and they put him into the back of the police vehicle. At this point two employees arrived from the crisis mobile unit and  joined the officers and the Sonora Behavioral Health employee outside the police vehicle. The patron was taken by the TPD vehicle and NAMI crisis left.","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","ID_0096",1,2024-04-16,0-01-01 11:46:00,"11:46:00","11:46:00 AM","Joel D.

After KW told them to cut the conversation and stop talking over the PC rows on Tuesday, Ariana Sierra, and Mia reported that the 3 boys told 8-year-old Mia that 14-year-old Mark (an unrelated boy not in the library at the time) ""wanted to put his penis inside her vagina"" and then called Sierra and Mia ""Black African Monkeys."" The girls reported that they did not tell staff at the time because they were worried ""staff would not do anything."" After the library closed, as they were crossing the street at 22nd street, the 3 boys threw an applesauce at Mia and got it all over her skirt. 
These 3 boys have a history of racial slurs and harassment directed at the girls. Their intention appears to be playful, but the impact is affecting the girls safety in the library, and they have been leaving early in order to avoid walking home at the same time as the boys. The girls reported to their parents who may come to the library to speak with staff.
After getting the report on 4/25/24, KVN instructed the girls to always tell staff when these situations occur, and stated that while there may not be consequences for the events on Tuesday, there will be strict consequences moving forward for discussion of sexually inappropriate topics, racial slurs, bullying, or comments that make them feel unsafe/uncomfortable. The girls reporting that they understand and felt supported.
On 4/26, KVN and NG met with Joshua privately. KVN asked for his version of events on Tuesday, explained that while his intention is playful, it is still hurting the girls' feelings, and that the impact on others matters. I informed him that if there are any more discussion of sexual topics in the library, including about body parts, or any more racial comments or slurs in the library, he will be suspended for 2 weeks.

L3s LAF and LD were waiting for them in the lobby with the plate mentioned in incident 0000023353, as well as a memo from the health department regarding magnets in the library. LAF gave Brendon back his plate and the memo, which stated that we should provide a space 6 inches away from electronics. LAF explained that staff had a table reserved just for them in Tortolita for Our Space, that more than met this requirement. Brendon said that he has visual issues that are also a problem in Tortolita due to the electronics. He debated and questioned the credentials of the county's director of the health department in the memo that was given to him. Brendan continued on saying that he had spoken with Adelita and that she agreed with him and that she told him she was going to make sure the library had to comply with his request to either remove the electronic control panel in Tortolita or have a metal box manufactured and placed over it. LAF told Brendon that we would not be making any accommodations beyond the reserved table today. LD mentioned that we are following administration's recommendations. Brendon began to argue and wanted a final word on this. LAF called LSM ED-L and filled him in on present circumstance. ED-L confirmed no further accommodations would be made. LAF relayed this to Brendon and LAF and LD gave him ED-L's card to contact him. Brendon began to demand ED-L come downstairs to speak with him. LAF confirmed with ED-L that he was busy in a meeting and unavailable and relayed this to Brendon as well. Brendon continued to press the issue and said that PCPL should get prepared to be sued and told LAF that she would be fired. Brendon accused staff of not caring and not wanting to be partners. LAF reminded Brandon that we do care and that we are trying to help them. LAF told that there was no further need for discussion on the matter, that we would not be making those additional accommodations, and that his statement was disrespectful. She told Brendon that if there was further disruption they would need to leave. Guard J also had walked up at this point and told Brendon he was being rude. Brendon said he was struggling because he was having to stand up and talk with LAF and LD. Both LAF and LD at once told him he could sit anywhere he liked and they could talk with him that way instead if he preferred it. Brendon said he would sit down and wanted LAF and LD to discuss the matter. LAF reiterated the decision would not change. Brendon sat on a bench with Michelle, who had been sitting for the entirety of the interaction. LAF and LD monitored the situation for around 10 minutes, until Brendon and Michelle headed to the 3rd floor. LAF and LD made their way to 3rd and LAF called LIC L2 CS to fill her in. Our Space staff had already been made aware of the plan to speak with Brendon prior to the program and were also prepared to hold the boundary of the reserved table only. Brendon went into Tortolita, stood in front of the electronic control panel while Michelle retrieved snacks, and then came over to the 3rd floor desk to talk further about the issue, while Michelle went downstairs. CS and L2 JM were also there at this point and became part of the conversation. Brendon simply repeated more of the same and said they would not be able to return to Main unless the panel was removed or a metal box was placed over it. As Brendon continued, LAF interrupted and said that there was no more they needed to discuss and that she and LD needed to converse on the matter and that she knew Brendon was busy also. Brendon asked for water, because Our Space had run out, so LAF asked him to meet her on the first floor and she would bring them bottles of water. When LAF met them with the water, Michelle asked if El Rio nurses were available today and she told Michelle yes. Brendon said Michelle would like to stay to see them and asked if that was okay. LAF said that would be totally fine as long as we had no further disruption whatsoever. Brendon agreed and said they did not want that either.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0055",1,2024-04-25,0-01-01 11:00:00,"11:00:00","11:00:00 AM","Joel D.

Gregory starts gathering belongings and staff exit bathroom. KN and MB waited outside bathroom hall to redirect any patrons who might need to use the men's restroom. Gregory comes out of the restroom and holds a finger as to signal to give him more time, then went back into the restroom and shut the door. Afterwards, staff could hear the water faucet being turned on repeatedly. KN then gets cordless phone to begin calling authorities at approx. 1:05. 
While KN was on the phone with the Sheriff's Department, Gregory exited the restroom and argued with staff about his suspension and other things, at one point claiming that KN does not work for the library. 
Gregory exited the building followed by staff, but remained on library property while KN finished the call with police. She provided the dispatcher with a physical description of Gregory. She was informed the officers were on the way, so she ended the call.

Lib 1 SG reported that Senad Gebrezgabher entered the library upset and instructed her not to ""shut off his PC if his mother asked."" Senad was on the PC and his mother, who spoke very little English, was requesting that he leave the library with her. Senad was refusing her request.
KVN sat with Senad and asked what was going on. He told her his mother was lying and that his father was supposed to pick him up. KVN asked the mother if Senad's father was coming and she understood and said ""No."" KVN was unable to explain to the mother that they could not ask Senad to leave (the mother was in a rush to get to work). The parental concern was the Senad would not have a way home after the library closed, due to the mother being at work and the father not coming. KVN expressed to Senad that he needed a way to get home when the library closed at 5pm and he said he would take the city bus. KVN asked him to tell his mother directly (in their language so she understood) and when he did it caused further argument. Senad was getting more vocal in his argument with his mother and refusal to leave, and multiple student patrons and parents were getting involved and instructing Senad to leave with his mother.
In order to avoid escalation, KVN told Senad he needed to have a conversation with his mother outside the library because he was causing a disturbance. KVN told Senad that she would not force him to leave with his mother, so if after the conversation he decided to come back inside that would be fine. But he needed to take the conversation outside the library. Senad argued a few times until KVN told him he could either take the conversation outside or he would be asked to leave for the day anyway.
After Senad shutdown his PC and started to leave with his mother, he shouted ""This is fucking bullshit."" He then shouted a few more obscenities. 
Because of his language and arguing with staff, KVN informed Senad that he was not allowed back in the library on 4/27.
At 11:35 the guard informed KVN that Senad had tried to re-enter 3 times, was still on library property, was being physically aggressive with his mother, and was bringing other students from the library outside to help argue his case. KVN went outside to remind Senad where the property line is (that he cannot be in the parking lot) and told him that she cannot make him go with his mom but he needs to leave library property for the day. KVN told the guard if Senad tries to come inside a 4th time then he will receive a 1 week suspension because he has been given multiple warnings.

NG tried to ask questions for more information, but the man kept not answering and telling her to call 9-1-1. L1 SG stepped in and learned the incident occurred off library property, prior to the library opening, and was a verbal (supposedly non-physical) altercation that needed reporting. SG directed them to the phone in the café area where the patrons called 9-1-1. 
On Friday, 4.26.24 between 11am - 12pm KVN was asked by LTASup JF to wake up patrons slumped over at the computer. They were the patrons who had made the phone call and were completely slumped over their chairs in unnatural positions at the PCs. KVN tried to verbally rouse the patrons by saying ""good morning"" and ""are you okay?"" to which the patrons did not respond. KVN then tapped the back of their chairs and tapped on their keyboard to create vibration. The patrons finally woke up so KVN let them know if they are not using the PC they can move to the café area to sit. The patrons laughed and displayed physical signs of drug/alcohol use (slurred speech, irrational mood, stumbling, unclear eyes) but left the library shortly after KVN woke them up.
On Saturday, 4.27.24 at 2:30pm a patron approached KVN at the desk and reported 2 patrons ""drunk."" KVN looked over to see the patrons slumped over in their chairs and the PCs in the front row. KVN went to approach them, and tried to verbally rouse them which did not work. Because they had objects on the floor obstructing access to their seats at the PC, KVN tapped the back of their chairs to wake them up. KVN delivered the same message as the day previously, and the patrons displayed the same signs of drug/alcohol intoxication.
However, as KVN walked away the male patron informed her as she reached the desk that she should not ""touch him"" or ""they would have problems."" KVN nodded and chose not to respond. The male patron reiterated that he would ""throw hands"" if she ""touched him"" again. KVN did not touch him physically, but touched the chair.
KVN did not respond so as to not escalate the patrons because this happened when there was no guard for backup while the patrons were under the influence. Based on the previous day, KVN assumed they would leave the library. The patrons left the library immediately afterward.

The library staff are familiar with this patron and had noticed his behavior getting worse over the last few weeks. Staff only knew a possible name, Milton, and that he may have lived in Maryland at some point. LII IC JM decided to call Crisis and she was told they would be there shortly. Two Crisis workers showed up at 10:40am to talk to the patron who was still sitting on the bench talking to himself loudly. The patron refused service from Crisis and said ""stop, stop"" Crisis informed LII IC JM and LII PP that because he refused service, they couldn't help him, but that they would check in with their supervisor to see what options, if any we may have. LIII LF came down to help with the situation, and offered the patron a snack bag, LA RW got a few cold milks to offer the patron to get him to calm down, and LIII LF offered him two choices, the milk and lowering his volume, or leaving for the day. The patron started talking loudly about the CIA, saying things that didn't make any sense and continued to be agitated and loud. LII LF decided that it was time for the patron to leave and asked him to leave for the day and that he could try to come back again tomorrow. The patron kept saying the same things and would not leave. LIII LF told him multiple times that he needed to leave for the day and he ignored her. LII IC JM called 911 and told them that we had a patron trespassing on the library property and that we had called crisis and he refused help so we needed police to respond to remove him from the library. Police said that they were going to send someone out as soon as they could and that police were responding to another incident at the moment, she was not given an estimated time of arrival. LII LF called 911 again to inform them that the patron was getting more agitated and escalating. The two crisis workers came back to tell library staff that because we didn't have more information from him, like treatment history, name and birthdate they could not take him to treatment against his will. Crisis encouraged staff to tell the police officers when they get to the library that the patron needs to be taken for mental health care. The patron began getting up from the bench and coming to the circulation desk, talking loudly to himself about the CIA and he leaned over the desk toward LTA NG, getting close to her, and then banged his fists on the desk, at which point LIII LF told him to back away from the desk. LII LF called 911 again to let them know that the patron was escalating and that he was impacting the library operations on the 1st floor and becoming potentially dangerous to both staff and patrons. TPD informed her that the incident was being elevated to a level two. One TPD officer arrived on bike an hour after being called initially, got the information from LII LF and went to speak to the patron and ask him to leave. The patron left after a few minutes, being walked to the door by the officer and he stood outside the door asking the officer where he was supposed to go, ""the airport.""

KVN looked at her watch to check the time and responded through the door ""We will open in 2 minutes at 10am, sir"" to which the patron shouted ""yeah, I'm sure you're really prompt, bitch."" The insult was said quieter but still audible. KVN put her stuff in the Large Meeting Room and grabbed Lib 1 SG for backup, explained the situation, and told her because there was not a guard and the patron was continuing to bang on the door with his cane and display aggressive behavior they needed to prepare for escalation as they issued a verbal warning. 
As KVN and SG walked up to open the doors, a female patron outside who was interacting with the male patron banging on the door moved away from him quickly and said ""Stay away from me."" KVN opened the door and told him ""You cannot bang on our door with your cane."" The patron responded with a mock salute and said ""Yes ma'am. Won't happen again."" KVN said ""If you continue to break library rules you will be asked to leave for the day."" The patron appeared to try to ""control himself"" by trying to speak and stopping himself several times and grumbling under his breath, said ""stop making things worse"" and then said ""Can I please just come in and do what I need to do?"" KVN let him in.
As the rest of the patrons entered, the female patron who had moved away told KVN ""He threatened me with his cane too"" and kept walking into the library. 
While the patron was inside the library, KVN was at the desk monitoring the situation with PC Guest Passes and his behavior with other patrons and staff. At one point the patron at the copier stared at KVN and audibly laughed in a hysterical, mocking way, which KVN ignored. The Patron left shortly after this.
Both SG and LA NG reported having regular issues with behavior from this patron, included harassment of staff, racism, proselytizing, and ranting.
When LIB 3 TFL re-entered from break, she consulted with the female patron and learned more about what occurred prior to the building opening. When she arrived, the patron made a comment under her breath about the library ""running late"" (the library opened on time according to library clocks) to which the male patron began ranting about government workers being lazy. He then started to talk about how ""God loves her"" and bring religion into it, to which she politely tried to redirect the conversation. When he did not stop, she asked him to stop talking to her. He then started pointing his cane at her and repeated told her that regardless of her beliefs ""God loves her"" and other comments along those lines. That is when she got up to move away and said ""Stay away from me,"" which KVN witnessed and overheard walking up to open the doors. Another, unrelated female patron reportedly stepped in before the doors finally opened and told the patron ""She asked you to leave her alone."" 
Due to the female patron report and his behavior toward staff today, this patron is suspended for 1 month. He will be served if he uses the library within the next 4 weeks. 
UPDATE 5/4: LIB 2 KVN noticed patron already in library and served patron suspension notice. KVN explained that because of the incident on 5/1 and a different patron's report, the patron had been suspended for 1 month and he could return on June 1st. Patron reported having congestive heart failure and argued with staff member about leaving the library. After looking at suspension notice, patron stated that ""rules are meant to be broken."" Patron continued to indicate he was cleaning up his items, but was laughing mockingly at KVN and attempting to engage in casual conversation with the guard. Patron pointed to his veterans vest with a PTSD patch and told KVN to ""read it."" KVN nodded and said that if he continues to not comply with her request and attempt to engage in conversation with others, she will have to call the police to remove him from the building as he is trespassing. The patron laughed again, mentioned ""white women"" and talked about KVN ""standing there like a school teacher"" while she waited for him to clear his items. 
After clearing his items, the patron started walking away and said ""white women ain't shit,"" and then pulled guard JQ in close to which JQ reported afterward that the patron said more derogatory comments regarding ""white women."" As the patron walked out, KVN informed him that because of his comments his suspension would no longer be for just one month, and that if he wanted to know how long it had been extended, he could call back at a later time. The patron stopped multiple times to make casual conversation about the bookbike, told JQ to have a good day, and on the way out the door told an older, white female patron that ""white women ain't shit"" as she walked into the building. 
After the patron had left the property, NG reported to KVN that during their interaction at the printer this morning, the patron had unprompted said ""Did you know there are no white people in the Bible?"" 
Due to his behavior, comments regarding ""rules are meant to be broken,"" comments regarding ""white people,"" and the disruption caused to staff and the library environment, this patron has been given a 6 month suspension starting today, 5/4.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0120",1,2024-05-01,0-01-01 09:58:00,"09:58:00","09:58:00 AM","Eckstrom-Columbus",0-01-01 09:00:00,"09:00-09:59"

As KVN approached, TFL was telling the unknown male patron that the behavior was unacceptable and he needed to leave. Ivo Ortiz remained seated and stared at the unknown patron while he paced, shouted, and made threats against his life. The unknown patron lifted a small potted tree to hit Ivo. TFL told the patron the police had been called and he needed to exit the building. He put the potted tree down. 
The male patron started to gather his items to leave, but continued to yell threats, move toward Ivo, displayed posturing, and escalation despite library requests to leave.

Ivo Ortiz made another (unheard) comment at the unknown patron, to which the patron grabbed a book a lifted it to start throwing it at Ivo. Lib 1 MC yelled ""Don't do that!"" in a very firm manner, which drew the patron's attention away from Ivo. The patron became aggressive toward MC and displayed posturing while making general threats about ""killing"" to everyone in the library.
KVN was on the phone with 9-1-1 requesting police. The male patron finally left the building but said he was going to stay outside, threatening to wait for Ivo to ""kill him"" and implied others as well. 
9-1-1 dispatch did not have an ETA on officer response and due to patron threats and escalation, COL locked down the building, filtering patrons who entered and exited. 
Ivo Ortiz continued to be unable to calm down in the library. Despite wanting to keep him inside for his safety and the safety of others, TFL was forced to ask him to leave the building as well.

KFW talked with patron about ways to accurately check out materials before giving patron the items that were stored behind the desk. Watching from afar to make sure the check out process went smoothly KFW observed Elijah pretend to check out the items by scanning the same book 5 times, and then quickly head for the door. KFW caught up with him and told him the items didn’t check out. He was slightly argumentative, but went back to the self-check and checked the books out with KFWs assistance.This interaction led us to investigate his account further where we noticed 50 items on his cancelled holds list in the last two months alone. We went down the list of 50 cancelled items and each one we checked with a barcode was missing. We double checked our shelves to verify they were missing. LTAS KFW put a note in his record at this point to keep holds behind the desk while KFW consults with L3 VS, and LSM KDL on how to proceed.

The guard said that there wasn't time to grab library staff, and according to the video, the gentleman arrived at 4:45pm and left by 4:46pm. Because staff have had several conversations with Mr. Littlepage about his issue with telling other patrons, specifically youth, what to do inside of the library and his failure to comply with the request, Mr. Littlepage will be suspended for 3 days. He will be informed of his suspension by SH when he returns to the library. His suspension will end and he may return to the library on 5/10/11.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0045",1,2024-05-06,0-01-01 17:28:00,"17:28:00","05:28:00 PM","Wheeler Taft Abbett",0-01-01 17:00:00,"17:00-17:59"

On 5/1/24 guard AB reported to L3 AG that there were two adult males sitting in the (busy and occupied by teens) teen area. LTA GP said that she had spoken to them earlier in the hour and that one of them was charging a medical device because ""none of the other outlets work,"" so GP had asked how much time he needed for his device (15 mins), and had agreed to let them stay in that area for that amount of time.
Because it had been well over 15 minutes since that conversation had taken place, AG went to talk to them. AG introduced herself and said she was aware of the special permission they'd gotten to continue charging the device, and asked how much longer they would need because, as they could see, the area was busy with young teens. He said he needed 10 more minutes, and AG reiterated that next time library staff would be happy to show them where the outlets were in the adult area because this area is reserved strictly for teens. He agreed and they left 10-15 mins later.
On 5/7/24 L3 AG needed to check on the status of some outdoor signage both on the front of the building and in the parking lot. A vehicle was parked near one of the signs and the two men from 5/1 were standing outside of it talking. As she approached, AG said to them, ""Hi, I'm just checking on some signs. No worries, you're both good,"" then afterward returned to the building. Minutes later the men came into the building and the one who had been charging the medical device complained to on-desk staff that someone had come out to look at a sign but that really they had discriminated against him and that he hadn't done anything wrong. Staff responded that it sounded like the sign was unrelated to him, and he responded that he was sure that it was in fact related to him. He was very agitated and on the verge of yelling, so staff went to get L3 AG. AG went to talk to him and explained that, just as she had told him, she had needed to look at a couple of signs out there because she was in the midst of ordering new signs, and reiterated that she had told him he hadn't done anything wrong. He agreed that she had said those things but that he did not believe her. He went on to say that he had at one time ""fallen asleep for 5 minutes"" at another branch and been trespassed for 30 days and that he didn't think that was fair. We then said that he owns four acres of land nearby and so his taxes fund the libraries, that he believes that all laws should apply to everyone equally and that if you're a thief, but he didn't finish that thought and instead went in a different direction and said that his son was a cop and had left Tucson because the cops here all engage in profiling, and more. AG allowed him to vent for a little while, and he quickly seemed to calm down.
He then asked where he could plug in his medical device because ""The last time I was here apparently I sat in the wrong area and they harassed me about it,"" perhaps not remembering that AG was the one who had that conversation with him. AG showed him the different places in the library where he could sit and plug his device in.
On 5/9 at about 10:30 AM a regular patron who has not previously posed any behavior problems came to the desk to say that a man had ""gotten into his face"" unprovoked and tried to start a fight with him. He was visibly rattled and his hands were shaking while making this report. L3 AG approached the alleged aggressor along with L1 PC as backup and saw it was the same man from 5/1 and 5/7, who was now sitting across a table from where the first patron's belongings were, charging his medical device. AG said that the other patron reported that he had tried to start something. He asked if we wanted to hear his side of the story and AG said yes. He reported that he had checked the far end of the table but there were no outlets on that side [there is in fact an outlet there but he hadn't seen it], so he had sat down across from the other patron, who had then told him that there was an outlet at the far end of the table. This caused him to take offense and start a verbal disagreement with the other patron. The other patron denied this version of events and maintained that he had not been the first to speak, and the two began arguing. AG told them that if they wanted to remain in the library they both needed to stop arguing with each other. The first patron said he would not sit near the other guy and began to pack up his things. PC offered him a study room, which he accepted, while the other patron reiterated his version of events to AG. AG told him that in the future if there's a problem with another person he was to come and get library staff rather than engage with that person, or he would be asked to leave. He agreed, and left the library before the hour was over.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0025",0,2024-05-09,0-01-01 10:30:00,"10:30:00","10:30:00 AM","Flowing Wells",0-01-01 10:00:00,"10:00-10:59"

After an incident on 4/11, Nate offered to Guard CS and Lib 3 TFL to bring ""his guys"" to ""jump"" the patron involved in the incident to prevent the behavior. Nate was told that while staff appreciated the protective sentiment, that would result in him getting in trouble and being removed from the library. Lib 3 KW has had conversations with Nate regarding hanging out on the Teen PCs with the teens, as Nate is over 18-years-old. Nate has ""shown documents"" to Guard CS to ""prove"" that he is currently 19-years-old. Recently, there has been conversations between staff and regular youth that Nate has involved regular library minor patrons in a car-jacking (unknown whether true). 
On 5/9, Guard CS saw Nate swapping vapes with a 13-year-old minor outside the front doors. Guard CS addressed Nate, hold him he cannot do that on library property, that exchanging vapes with a minor especially could result in the police getting involved, and that Nate has been talked to about hanging out with minors in the library. Nate told CS that he ""hangs out with these kids after the library closes"" all the time and that Nate ""can't tell him what to do"" off library property. Nate brought up the legalities of spending time along with unrelated minors, and CS ended the conversation.
TFL and Lib 2 KVN asked Nate to have a private meeting in the Small Meeting Room. TFL reiterated that Nate also needed to make decisions to protect himself, that spending time alone with minors, and that exchanging vapes, could open up a host of legal troubles for Nate. TFL explained that library staff were not accusing Nate of any wrongdoing, but that library staff needed to help protect minors inside the library and staff need Nate to spend time with adults while inside the library. Nate stated that he is ""part of the same age group"" as the minors, stating that 13 and 19 are roughly the same age. Staff explained that while they may have a lot in common and they may have relatability, Nate is an adult and has to make adult choices. Staff also guided Nate toward the idea that being a good role model for the youth he spends time with is something to consider, and asked him if he was making the best choices by smoking with youth and engaging in (as he stated) ""the lifestyle on the streets"" with them. Nate appeared open to understanding needing to protect the youth from certain realities, explaining that he carries a gun ""on the streets"" but does not bring it to the library, and that he does not want to get the cops involved in anything as he ""has an active warrant."" Nate shook hands with TFL that he will no longer engage with minors inside the library without their guardians present, and that he understands that any sort of vape/smoking on library property with minors is not allowed. 
At 4:30pm, TFL noticed Nate on library property with 2 minors and another adult patron. Guard CS stood outside to send the message that Nate's behavior was being monitored as he was violating his agreement from his private conversation earlier in the day.
At around 5:00pm, Nate had another private conversation with Guard CS where Nate approached and said ""they approached me"" and asked what he is supposed to do if the youth won't leave him alone. Guard CS CS gave him good advice on how to verbally tell youth to disengage with him on library property. CS also reiterated the same points we made in our private conversation and told him directly that if he continued his behavior there would likely be further consequences.
At 5:12, after getting the flags, LTA DM reported to KVN that he still saw the patron, on library property, engaging with the main minor in question.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0120",0,2024-05-09,0-01-01 13:00:00,"13:00:00","01:00:00 PM","Eckstrom-Columbus",0-01-01 13:00:00,"13:00-13:59"

We believe there is one individual who is using the room inappropriately. Several of the chairs and under the desks had stains. Our LPI has caught him watching pornography, but no children were present, and he would close his browser immediately once he realized someone was watching. The LPI did not see him touching himself. Additionally, there is a long history of the computer behind wherever this patron was sitting having the power or the internet unplugged. The janitor also informed KS that someone was spitting chewing tobacco on the floor at one of the computers that patron regularly sat at - no one caught him chewing tobacco. 
February 20, 2024, staff noticed 5 chairs in the computer classroom had white stains near the edge. These were cleaned. Around February 21, KS informed the individual that we thought there was ""inappropriate behavior in the computer classroom and since he was there so often, we would appreciate if he would let us know if there was anything inappropriate happening in there"". He asked what happened and KS told him that several of the computer chairs had to be cleaned because someone was doing something they should not at the library. The patron responded with ""I haven't seen anything and I don't know who would do something like that...I'll let you know if I see anything.""
March 26, 2024, staff noticed 2 chairs in the computer classroom had the same stains. We had these cleaned. For the next week, staff regularly checked on the computer classroom during their ""Roaming hour"" and even sat in the back of the room for 5-10 minutes several times a day but did not catch him doing anything in appropriate. 
May 9, 2024, one staff member used a black light and there were stains under three of the desks - two of these desks were where that patron usually sits. Earlier that week, one of the computers that we had a sign to ""stop unplugging the computer"" was unplugged again after this patron used the computer in front of it. Per LSM AR, we will close the computer classroom and only use it for computer classes, one-on-ones, or if we run out of computers in the main area of the library.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0033",0,2024-05-10,0-01-01 10:00:00,"10:00:00","10:00:00 AM","Oro Valley",0-01-01 10:00:00,"10:00-10:59"

LIC LI MG was called to address two older teens fighting in the Ignite Space and she told the group of teens, including this patron to stop cursing because everyone in the library can hear it, even down on the 1st floor due to the balcony and where they are sitting. She and the guard asked them to stop fighting or even pretending to fight in the ignite space. LII IC JM and Vet Sec Guard L went over to the space about an hour later to talk to the patron and another older teen who is one of our regular patrons about horseplay in the ignite space. The patron said that it was ""bullshit"", and he didn't believe there was a rule about pretending to fight another teen in the library and LII IC JM assured him that this is a code of conduct violation and retrieved a printout from the 2nd floor desk underlining all of the code of conduct violations currently happening and offering the piece of paper to the teens. The teens refused the code of conduct printout and the patron still continued to argue about being able to fight in the space and so LIC LII JM told the patron to leave for the rest of the day, and try to come back again another day. The patron and a group of his friends left the library, one of them stating that it is better to leave for the day than to argue and get kicked out for longer. About 20 minutes later the patron came back in with another friend and ignored LIC LII JM when she said he was suspended for the day and needed to leave. The patron sat down at a 2nd floor table in the stacks and started texting. LIC LII JM and Vet Sec Guard D went over to the patron at the table and told him again he would need to leave and that he will be suspended for a week. The patron still sat at the table denying that he had done anything wrong or that he could be asked to leave. When Vet Sec Guard D informed the patron that the next step was the police, the patron said that he couldn't have the police show up because he is on probation.

I then walked over to the man on the phone and before I even had the opportunity to say anything he waved me off and told me to go away. I remained and said I was coming over to ask him to keep his conversation quieter or to offer him a study room to use, he proceeded to ask me my name and said that he's seen me ignoring homeless patrons at the branch and nit-picking people's behaviors and called me a ""Karen."" I went to the desk to write my name down for him and he proceeded to call me a Karen and said he bets I voted for Biden. Our guard G came over to support me and he said, ""I can't even take her seriously with that mask on, tell her to not come over here."" As this was going on he was packing up his belongings and logging out of his computer session in order to leave so I did not engage him further. He left continuing to mumble about me being a Karen and stuff about guard G's mask.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0073",0,2024-05-17,0-01-01 13:14:00,"13:14:00","01:14:00 PM","Sam Lena-South Tucson",0-01-01 13:00:00,"13:00-13:59"

Guard Jen called LIC L3 LAF to inform her of the situation and that Jen had spoken with Richard and asked him to stop arguing with others. Richard complied. He was also lying on the ground and showing people a wound on his leg, including guard Karen. Richard entered the building at opening without issue. LAF was assisting front desk staff with opening when staff member LTA NG reported to her that two customers were arguing. Richard was again arguing with another customer. LAF spoke with Richard, he stopped arguing, went to the restroom, and LAF remained on 1st floor to monitor the situation. LA RW, also staffing the desk, reported to LAF that Richard had requested a phone number for a bank in Grant Park. Richard came out of the bathroom and LAF gave him the number and a reusable water bottle. Richard was defensive and as LAF was trying to help him, Richard used dismissive language toward her, and after requesting instructions on how to use the courtesy phone, told her to ""stand down"" and to ""stop talking"" as she was giving him the instructions he had requested. After using the phone, Richard informed LAF he needed a ride to the bank and that getting to the bus was too difficult for him because of the wounds on his feet and leg. LAF offered Crisis and Richard accepted. LAF called and Crisis said they could not support with this request. LAF offered to call TPD non-emergency and EMS, if he wanted care for his wounds. Richard refused both. Richard made more calls, asked LAF for help again, and finally asked her to call TPD non-emergency, who also said they could not help with a ride. Richard again told LAF to stop talking as she was trying to assist him and get information so she could help. LAF told Richard he was being rude to her and that if he was going to be disruptive and rude to staff, he'd need to leave. LAF said she could try Sun Van, as Richard said he was registered with them. Richard said he would sit down and wait. LAF provided the info Richard gave her and Sun Van said he was not in their system. LAF asked for an exception and they refused. LAF wrote down phone numbers for Sun Van and gave them to Richard and explained that this had been her last option to help. Richard became angry and started telling LAF it was her fault they weren't coming and said she ""didn't fucking listen"" to him.

After 4 minutes of trying to speak to the patron, RW went to get LIB III KS. RW told KS that the person was yelling at her because her daughter had a collection agency fee and was swearing. The patron started the call by asking ""What the hell is going on that you would send my daughter to collections?!"" RW was able to get the daughter's card number to look at the account but was unable to get more information and the patron kept yelling over her. 
LIB III KS took the call and the patron started by using a clipped tone - ""Do I have to repeat everything I just said or did she tell you what is going on?!"" KS explained she knew some of what was going on and tried to explain that the library does not credit report and the collection agency is just to help contact people when the library has not received a response, and we could send her information to another department to waive it. The patron yelled over KS most of the time, so it was hard to tell if she heard anything. She asked for KS's manager at one point and then talked over her when she tried to tell her and give her a phone number. At one point, she yelled, ""This is bullshit!"" KS told her that she would not speak to her while she was yelling and cursing and said I'm hanging up. KS hung up the call and the patron called back immediately. KS told the patron before she could say anything that she wanted to help her; however, she could not speak to staff like that and to please stop cursing. The woman yelled ""it was one swear word, you need to relax!"" KS told her that she was hanging up again until she was calmer - the patron was still yelling at this point and KS hung up again. 
The patron called back repeatedly and the phones were busy. Finally Sub Librarian CB took the call and she said the woman mostly yelled without swearing, and asked how CB would feel if she got back from Mexico and found out that her child had been sent to collections. She would not allow CB to explain or offer to send it to another department to waive the fees and she finally hung up on CB. 
KS referred her to LIB III VS to consider waiving the collection agency fee. VS was able to call her a few hours later and resolve the issue.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0033",1,2024-05-20,0-01-01 13:35:00,"13:35:00","01:35:00 PM","Oro Valley",0-01-01 13:00:00,"13:00-13:59"

At one point the patron was walking quickly behind librarian DB, who was approaching her office in the front of the library and when the librarian turned around to glance over her shoulder the patron diverted her path to go into another part of the building. Library staff began restocking the food pantry cabinet at approximately 11:15am and observed the patron pacing, staring and mumbling to herself. While LA CS and Page AY were working together, the patron kept her distance, but paced and kept staring at library staff that was working. When LA CS left the area to obtain more supplies, Lyra Perry approached the food pantry and entered the enclosed space that had been set up for page AY to finish the restocking. DB observed the patron moving quickly toward the pantry and heard the card and cabinet door being moved, she approached the food pantry cabinet to observe the situation, as staff had mentioned their discomfort at being watched and stared at by this patron for the bulk of the morning. When she approached the patron was standing mere inches from the page AY and was talking to her. DB asked the patron to please refrain from crowding staff in such close quarters. The patron said that they were just asking a question and the librarian said that that was fine to do, but that staff needed more space to complete this task and that the pantry would be available as soon as staff was finished. DB remained in the area while AY finished stocking the cabinet. Following that interaction, the librarian approached Lyra Perry with a printed copy of the customer code of conduct to share with the patron. She offered the code of conduct and indicated the behaviors that were problematic, crowding, staring and stalking library staff. The librarian emphasized that while all customers are welcome in the library, not all behaviors are welcome in the library. The patron immediately defended her actions and stated that she knew her library manners and that the librarian was a hindrance to library services. The patron requested the Librarian's full name and LSM's full name. The librarian provided the requested information to the patron.

""While I was stocking the food pantry, a woman come over and slightly moved the cart with her body to get into the small space I was in. I had the cart right behind me so I could just turn around to place the items from the cart to the pantry.

Upon further investigation, KVN found out from the staff member the patron David Durazo had been displaying following behaviors, watching her, and engaging in uncomfortable conversations with her. The patron behavior has been going on for 5+ months, with the staff member making infrequent reports about having to leave CM duties when she feels uncomfortable. The staff member reported in the beginning, David would attempt to ask more questions about her personal life, but over time she has stopped engaging and this has resulted in shortened conversations - but he still tries to engage in small talk daily. These interactions of David following her to various areas of the library, stationing himself in the areas where she is working, and having brief interactions with her occur every day that she works. 
On Thursday, 5/23 David Durazo was seen by KVN interacting briefly with the reporting staff member in an unusual location (the children's area), but KVN was unaware of the situation at the time. However, this interaction was the most recent occurrence where other staff were witness to the behavior. Several other staff have reported noticing David Durazo's behavior around certain staff.
On Friday, 5/25 David Durazo made it a point to approach this staff member to ask permission to charge his phone in a spot where he is frequently seen charging his phone (so is aware he can charge his phone in this spot) and then circled back several minutes later to ask how the staff member was doing. The staff member kept the conversation short but reported to KVN after it occurred. 
COL staff report David is a regular who is at the library almost every day.
During the investigation, KVN also learned that this staff member may not be the only one experiencing the same interactions with David. David Durazo has had a history with another staff member in the building, including inappropriate interactions that occurred outside the library.
KVN will follow up with Guard CS next week to determine if he has more information about David Durazo. After determining if there is further information, KVN will follow-up with JB and issue a verbal warning to David Durazo regarding limiting interactions with staff to library-related functions only.

That is when MC made the connection regarding the patron and printed the suspension letter.

LTA Sup AP approached the woman and she stated that the dog was young and was her emotional support animal. AP informed her that only service animals were allow in the building and offered to help the woman with whatever services she needs. The woman asked for a cup so that she can give her dog water. AP filled up a cup of water for her at which point L3 KK arrived to speak to the woman. L3 KK discovered the woman was in distress and her 2 year old husky named Conrad was her emotional support animal. L3 KK told the woman that she can try to come back again tomorrow but if the dog is disruptive again that we would have to ask him to leave again. KK also offered to call for assistance which the customer declined. KK spoke to customer until she appeared calm. KK helped the customer carry her items out to her car. Customer said she was going to drive to her parents house. KK walked away as the customer appeared ready to leave.
In the 2PM hour, a different customer spoke with the woman and learned that the woman had found the dog earlier that day abandoned in a park. The second customer convinced the woman to surrender the dog to them and the second customer also called the crisis team for her. The second customer was prepared with a collar, leash, and vest for the dog. The crisis team showed up and spoke to the woman and they all left.

Guard CS and JB went outside and discovered Rufus, a regular dog who is usually attended by his teen human Zay Lopez, alone in the parking lot. Rufus was hiding under a car, and when CS and JB tried to coax him out, Rufus was barking aggressively, raising his hackles, snarling, and lunging at CS and JB. 
L2 KVN took over and went outside. While CS attempted to offer Rufus water and befriend Rufus, KVN called PACC dispatch to report a loose and aggressive dog. Rufus continued to act aggressively toward CS, and when CS stood up to move away from Rufus, Rufus lunged forward and acted as though he wanted to bite CS's leg. Rufus did not respond positively to any attempts to help him or bring him to safety inside, and neither CS nor KVN could get close without a potential bite risk. 
Rufus eventually moved to the edge of library property and waited under a tree, but continued to bark aggressively at CS, KVN, and other cars driving by. He then ran across Columbus street to a car dealership. PACC said there would be no ETA for assistance. 
Once off property, KVN went inside and got assistance from JB and LTA DM to find Zay's library account and call him. While on the phone, Zay said ""that crazy dog man!"" and reported he had been looking for him everywhere. Zay said ""it's too hot to be doing this, man"" in reference to picking up his dog. KVN reported that Rufus was at the dealership across Columbus street and that PACC had been called if they couldn't find him. Zay indicated he was on his way.
Fortunately, Zay and Rufus did reunite and Rufus is safe and re-entered the library around 1pm. Unfortunately, while Rufus is normally behaved inside the library, the behavior he showed while scared was concerning to staff and patrons. Additionally, Zay has been seen repeatedly leaving Rufus unattended in the library the last week and leaves multiple bowls of water for Rufus all over the library (including near PCs).

There have been recent incidents between a female patron and Nate, where the female patron has reported Nate for rape and calls 911 from a personal cell when he enters the library with her present. There has been no police response and staff have remained aware but uninvolved. The female patron leaves when Nate arrives at the library, but there are some incidents of arguing. 
Yesterday, Nate asked Guard CS for money for the vending machine and CS warned him that he cannot ask people for money. Nate was not accepting of that feedback. Nate also reported to CS being able to acquire new guns (he told KVN a few weeks ago he lost his gun in a recent shoot out at Reid Park). Nate's reporting on having/carrying guns repeatedly to multiple staff is seen as threatening. 
Today, while on desk Nate shared more details about his life with KVN. He discussed ODing, mixing drugs that exploded, and showed KVN a new (red) vape he acquired. KVN reminded Nate that he cannot smoke it in the library. Nate told her ""he's not stupid,"" to which KVN said she knew, and was just reminding him. Nate then told KVN that he vapes on the 2nd floor of MAI all the time, but would step outside to smoke a cigarette. He requested a snack (there was one snack leftover for adults which KVN provided).
Nate then asked KVN to buy him something from the vending machines. KVN used the same excuse as previous conversations and simply said ""I'm sorry Nate, I don't have money."" Nate pushed further and asked ""You don't have a card?"" and which KVN just said ""I'm sorry, I can't.""
Nate then said ""You done messed up Kelli."" He shook his head and started walking away and repeated louder ""You messed up Kelli.""
KVN did not respond.

Angelina reported having a guardian picking her up, and claimed the guardian was on her way. SG warned Angelina that if her ride had not picked her up by around 5:10pm, staff would be required to sit and wait with her, and at 5:15pm would be required to call the police because it is not a safe area for her to be left alone. SG suggested she make arrangements with her guardian to be picked up at the Burger King across the street, as then she would have more public eyes on her.
At 5:10pm, as staff were leaving COL after close, SG reported to L2 KVN that Angelina was still sitting by herself in the front of the building. An unknown adult male was loitering nearby.
KVN approached Angelina and asked about the status of her ride. Angelina stated that she hadn't heard back from her foster mom, but that she was sure she was on the way. 
Once it was clear staff were staying with her, the unknown adult male left on his bike. 
KVN and Guard CS stayed with Angelina. KVN asked a few more questions from Angelina, and received inconsistent and (at times) incoherent information. Angelina reported being in foster care ""since last month"" and ""since the end of last year."" She reported being with her current foster mother ""for 4 months"" and ""since [she] was 4."" Angelina stated both that this ""happens all the time"" and that this had ""never happened before."" Angelina reported her foster mother has having ""3 other children"" she was picking-up, and changed her answer when KVN inquired (to build rapport and ease her anxiety) how many of the other kids were her siblings. Angelina also said she was living in a shelter while they waited for housing. 
KVN told Angelina she was going to wait until 5:20pm to call the non-emergency line, hoping to give her guardian more time. KVN asked if Angelina would be comfortable giving KVN her guardian's phone number so KVN could attempt to call her, as Angelina said she had not heard back from her guardian at all. Angelina said she could only message/call her through Facebook messenger and did not have her number.
At 5:20pm Angelina still reported not having heard from her guardian and how close she was. KVN called the non-emergency line and, while on the phone, Angelina immediately started saying she did have her guardians phone number and she had been texting her and she had heard back. 311 indicated they were dispatching an officer with an undetermined ETA.
At closer to 5:30pm, Angelina's guardian arrived. KVN approached the vehicle and Angelina's foster mom got out of the car and stared KVN down with crossed arms. KVN explained the library's policy regarding unattended children, and that for Angelina's safety staff stayed with her after close. KVN explained that she was required to call the non-emergency line for an officer to be dispatched, but that now that she was being picked-up KVN would be canceling the call. KVN also explained that it would be safer to Angelina to make alternative pick-up arrangements if she cannot be picked-up by the library closing time, such as meeting at the Burger King across the street. 
Angelina's guardian rolled her eyes and said ""Just one more fucking thing I have to deal with."" She then drove away.
KVN called 311 to cancel officer dispatch. 
This PITS is to serve as documentation that this conversation took place, that Angelina was incoherent and inconsistent, and that the guardian was not open to the information. Angelina Ibarra has a mother listed in her Sierra record - undetermined if the guardian identified by Angelina as her ""foster mother"" is the one in her Sierra record or not. 
UPDATE Saturday, 6/15: Angelina came to the desk with her 4-year-old sister and asked KVN for a guest pass for the PCs. She also asked for a study room. Throughout the day, Angelina and her little sister asked for KVN for help with books, coloring pages, SLP materials, and a 30min extension on the study room. Angelina was much more coherent and open with KVN, and made sure to check-out with KVN at the desk at 4:30, saying they were getting picked up, and asked for a weekend pack. Her little sister got a free SLP book. This showed a positive shift after the previous day's incident.","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0120",1,2024-06-14,0-01-01 17:30:00,"17:30:00","05:30:00 PM","Eckstrom-Columbus",0-01-01 17:00:00,"17:00-17:59"

Sub TS informed Mary that her 2 hours in the Study Room was up at 12:45pm and another patron was booked at 1pm, and Mary agreed to move her items. Mary asked if she could extend her time/use another study room, and TS let her know there is a 2 hour max in the study room per day (KVN was present for the conversation). 
At 1:30pm, Page HP received a call from Mary asking to book a study room for today. HP did not think she was the same person from the previous booking and gave her Study Room #2 again from 3pm - 5pm. Mary did not convey she had already used a study room that day.
At around 2:45pm, TS communicated to L2 KVN that Mary had re-entered the study room and had an additional booking. TS reminded her that she had already reached her 2-hour limit and Mary said ""I called and they told me it was okay.""
Mary was in Study Room #2 prior to her 3pm booking (at around 2:45pm), without asking for entry from desk staff.
On previous Fridays and Saturdays, KVN has had to ask Mary to leave a study room past her booking time or when she did not have a reservation at all. Mary has set up in the study rooms without permission at least twice before.
Due to the history with Mary, KVN printed the COL website that outlines the 2-hour max daily limit, and asked Mary to leave the study room. KVN reminded Mary that TS had already explained that she reached her 2 hour limit for the day. At first Mary said ""that's not how it is at other libraries,"" to which KVN explained they may have other policies because they have more or less study rooms available or it's a less busy day. Mary then said ""I didn't see that on your website"" so KVN showed her the printed website information. 
KVN invited Mary to continue to use the rest of the library to work. Mary finally complied with the request.
At 3:15pm, LTA AO let KVN know there was a patron on the phone asking to speak with the manager. 
When KVN answered the call, the male patron on the phone Jacob Weill did not identify the situation directly but immediately started saying that the tech team needs to ""update the website"" and discussed how confusing it is that the link under the Eckstrom-Columbus Library page labeled ""study rooms"" goes to a list for all meeting/study rooms in PCPL, and that patrons have to click on the ""Meeting Rooms"" tab to find out the 2-hour study room limit policy. The male patron reported this as being ""not intuitive"" and said that if [we] updated the website, [we] could avoid situations where staff make ""patrons feel embarrassed"" and like they were ""intentionally skirting the rules"" when they ""simply did not know the policy"" and staff were creating an ""unwelcoming environment"" by not having ""verbal information"" or ""signs.""
Jacob Weill then stated that signs need to be put up ""in the library entrance, at the service desk, and on the study room doors"" explaining the 2-hour limit policy to ensure that situations do not occur where ""adults could feel like they are unknowingly violating the policies when they are just trying to do homework.""
KVN listened to Jacob, told him she would talk to the tech team to see if the adjustment could be made on the website, and that she made note of the request for signs regarding the policy. KVN spoke very little during the phone call and did not directly discuss the incident. The phone call ended with issue apparently resolved. 
KVN will discuss with management whether library technology needs to update branch page regarding study room policies.

This affected a patron in the middle of an application at the job help computer.
L2 KVN went to investigate. KVN explained to the patron that it is against policy to unplug library technology.
The patron was slightly incoherent, and argued that he had to because ""his phones were dying."" The patron had 2 different phones (a smart phone and a flip phone) and unplugged multiple PCs to charge them. He said the USB port on his PC wasn't working to charge his flip phone and he needed to plug it in so his flip phone ""would never die again"" and he would ""never have to return to the library.""
KVN explained that if he needed help finding a plug for his devices, staff at the desk could help him find a wall outlet or book a study room for him.
The patron argued that the outlets under the desk are ""basically the same."" 
KVN explained that there is additional technology and electrical wiring involved in the PC plugs, and that the library has an entire IT department dedicated to that section of the library which is why unplugging those devices is prohibited.
The patron asked what ""IT"" meant, to which KVN re-explained the acronym. The patron then began to discuss technology, chemistry, how computers are made, and how he could ""never figure out how to put the PC inside the box."" 
KVN re-iterated that he was more than welcome to plug in his devices into the USB port on the PC or an open wall charger in the café area, but if he needed additional help finding a charging spot, he needed to ask desk staff for help and not unplug any library devices. The patron finally indicated he understood and would not do it again.
The patron on the job help PC will return tomorrow to finish his application. KVN had previously helped him with his application and assured him most of his work would be saved because he created an account.

COL staff had already received multiple complaints and concerns about aggressive petition passers in the parking lot. L1 MNC approached him to let him know about the branch's rules for petition passing and expectations as outlined in the Board of Supervisors policy and our Code of Conduct. He stated that the Code of Conduct and Board Policy do not supersede his rights under the law. He then started arguing about AZ Revised Statutes and the 1st Amendment in a very hostile and confrontational way. MNC and Guard CS asked if he was willing to abide by our code of conduct in order to continue his activities and he stated that he was not. MNC let him know that he was being asked to leave the property due to his refusal. The petition passer said that he would not leave and kept trying to argue the law. L1 MNC disengaged as the conversation was not productive. Staff called 911 for support as the passer was being hostile with staff, refusing to leave and continued to approach patrons directly in front of the library doors. L1 MNC and L2 KVN both went to the door and served the petition passer his suspension paperwork.  LI JCB observed the interaction from the lobby and informed LIII KW of the situation.
He demanded MNC's last name multiple times as staff tried to disengage and walked away. MNC did not provide his last name. The petition passer then continued approaching patrons while waving the suspension letter and shouting that the library was denying him his rights.
L1 MNC felt concerned for his safety when leaving the branch at 2:30pm as the petition passer was still circling the parking lot. Branch manager KW walked with him to make sure that the passer did not continue his aggressive behavior toward him. MNC quickly made his way towards his car when the passer approached a family exiting their vehicle on the other side of the parking lot.

Mya and Keysasi said they were walking home with the bunnies. They came back inside to try to call for a guardian, but no one answered, so they said they were taking them home.

She handed him a code of conduct and let him know that she was just warning him about his behavior. 
A few minutes later Chris approached JNB and introduced himself, apologized for his language and said he did not realize he was being so loud.

LAF said she would find out if it was crafts for the public to use generally or if it was a craft table for the presenter. After inquiring with LA KV, LAF found it was a craft table for a presenter. LAF told Our Space staff if Michelle wanted to participate, they could give her craft supplies at their table. LAF returned to Brendon and told him this. Brendon did not yell, but did raise his voice, and said that was unacceptable and that it is discrimination. LAF said she was offering a way for Michelle to participate. Brendon said, “Get EDL now.

During the next 10 minutes, Angelina continued to scream, “Get the fuck away from me,” as well as multiple threats towards herself and others. She said multiple times that if the police came, she would force them to shoot and kill her, both before Officer Bonnano arrived and directly to him. She told CS several iterations of, “I’ll fuck you up like I fucked up my mom. You’d better watch it outside, because when I see you…” and then punched the wall and a nearby chair repeatedly. She also kept saying that she would “give them what they want,” accused CS and the guards of filming her, and said that she “was fine until this white bitch [CS] showed up and called the cops.” LSM EDL arrived on 3rd. LAF and LD began clearing people off the 3rd floor. LSM KDL secured the interior of the door to 4th floor administrative offices. 
Angelina continued to scream while officer Bonnano radioed for backup. Shortly thereafter, several officers arrived on the elevator and took Angelina into custody. CS left the scene, as her presence seemed to be agitating Angelina and the stairs were no longer under threat. LAF and LD took over at this point.","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0026",1,2024-06-27,0-01-01 16:27:00,"16:27:00","04:27:00 PM","Joel D.

KVN listened with Petitioner 2 stated that Petitioner 1 and her had worked together at a previous library, and they were working for the same petition under different companies. Petitioner 2 claimed that Petitioner 1 had become aggressive and used profane language toward her at the previous library (indicating an East library location), and that Petitioner 2 ended up calling the police about it. She claimed Petitioner 1 had been slamming her clipboard and threatening her. Petitioner 2 claimed that Petitioner 1 is a ""druggie"" and uses her petitioning money for that. Petitioner 2 stated she had asked Guard CS to call 911 for her when Petitioner 1 arrived, but Guard CS had not seen any aggressive behavior and told her she was welcome to call 911 herself or talk to staff, but he was not going to call on her behalf. Petitioner 2 also claimed that she had been ""banned"" from the previously noted East library due to their altercation, and that (unfairly) Petitioner 1 had not been banned. Petitioner 2 repeatedly implied KVN should ask Petitioner 1 to leave. 
After listening to her concerns, KVN asked her to wait inside the library so she could check PITS. KVN did not see any recent PITS or suspensions involving these petitioners.
KVN met with both petitioners outside and had a conversation with both petitioners about PCPL Code of Conduct. She explained to both of them that if there was any aggressiveness, threatening language, profanity, or the creation of a hostile environment for patrons, that both petitioners would be suspended from all Pima County libraries.

KVN told her that she has the right as a citizen to do whatever she needed to do, but warned both of them to work in separate areas in front of COL. KVN explained, again, that they needed to simply avoid and not engage with one another or they would both receive consequences.  Both petitioners seemed to understand PCPL Code of Conduct and that library staff were not going to be monitoring their history of conflict outside of issuing appropriate consequences for behavior from both parties.

The other female released her, but when she started to walk away she grabbed her from behind and started holding her aggressively. KVN got closer to them and instructed them to stop. The instigating female glared at KVN unbreakingly for several moments and then released the female patron again.

Mr. Bulikowski began explaining to CR about what he thinks is a ""glitch"" in our system which he had spent months trying to get LTA MM to explain to his satisfaction. Mr. Bulikowski habitually returns items that are overdue and billed. He noticed that when an item is billed, it disappears from the public catalog and he claims that sometimes the items never show back up in the catalog. The only instance that he could provide of this at the moment was the billed item he had just returned moments before, which had not reappeared in the public catalog. CR tried to explain to him that the removal from the public catalog was an automated process and the books would reappear when the system updated. Mr. Bulikowski insisted that was not the case, but again was only able to provide the one example. CR attempted to explain that things could disappear from the catalog for many different reasons, but Mr. Bulikowski insisted that there was a problem.

LHN was on desk at 11am and did not recall any patron coming in to ask for the phone or this specific patron asking for computer help. LHN let her know that we cannot help with what was on the computer but that she could make a phone call from the free pay phone and to not ask other people outside to use their phones. The patron then said “but she said I could use hers and then started talking about no I’m at work and you can’t use my phone, I was going to recruit you but now I’m not. Is this a free phone or is it not, now I have you here threatening me.” While moving towards LHN. LHN let her know she was not threatening her and that we aren’t trying to get her to leave, we just need to know what happened so we can help her. The patron then started to yell “No one is helping me and people keep erasing my information. I don’t deserve to be outside, you’re in the f*****g way and keeping me from making a phone call.” Police officer on site MA then came up and told the patron that she did need to leave because she was being heard from inside the library and was being disruptive and using threatening language by cussing at staff. Police officer and security guard MG then escorted the patron off library premises. LHN later approached the CADC member to let her know to direct patrons inside the library for help at the front desk and to not engage with anything else. CADC member said that she did let the patron know to go inside and that she could not help with making a phone call or text message because she was working and ""didn’t want to get caught up in her personal business."" The CADC member was not asked to leave for the day because they did calm down and walked away after LHN initially approached both people asking what happened.

Guard BJ approached Librarian I KB sometime in the early afternoon to say that a library customer (LC1) had been talking to him and another library customer (LC2) in the lobby about being afraid to go home because she was afraid that her husband might try to kill her. BJ wanted to know if he was obligated to report this information to the police. KB told him no, but gave BJ the phone number for Emerge for him to pass along to her. 
At around 3:45pm Guard BJ told LB1 KB that 911 had been called ""hours"" ago, but no one had arrived. Seeking clarification about whether or not the customer had spoken with someone at Emerge, KB spoke to LC1, who said that she had not, but instead had called 911 after being directed to call the police by someone at Tucson Medical Center, who LC1 had called instead of Emerge at the urging of LC2 in the lobby. LB1KB then dialed the Emerge phone number from the courtesy phone in the lobby and handed LC1 the phone. The Emerge rep was able to find a translator for LC1 (who was Chinese), enabling LC1 to better communicate her situation. While LC1 was on the phone with Emerge, a TPD officer arrived. LC1 hung up with Emerge and met with the officer in the meeting room. LC1 told BJ and KB that Emerge did not have a bed for her and that she was instructed to call other shelters. The TPD officer called a shelter, too, but did not get an answer. The officer gave LC1 a Victim Notification pamphlet with phone numbers to two other domestic violence crisis lines. LC1 indicated to BJ and KB that she was just going to go home. BJ and KB strongly urged LC1 to go to the emergency room at St. Joseph's Hospital to call the two other phone numbers, as the library would be closing soon. KB explained that these shelters were different than Emerge and hopefully they would have something available. The officer quickly explained to LC1 the process of getting a restraining officer, and KB gave her a list of cooling centers that are open on Sundays.","Yes","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0120",0,2024-07-27,0-01-01 15:45:00,"15:45:00","03:45:00 PM","Murphy-Wilmot",0-01-01 15:00:00,"15:00-15:59"

LIB KV let the children know that it is very important to be picked up by 6:00 pm since the area is not safe and library staff would have to call the police if they are not picked up within 15 minutes of closing.  LIB SG said she would stay with Guard CS to wait for the parent.  Parent showed up around 6:18 pm for the kids and LIB SG approached the vehicle to inform the parent about the library's policy.
LIB SG approached the parent driving a pickup truck who seemed agitated.

However, no further actions were taken in her case since the kids informed library staff that a parent was on their way.

Patron also indicated that they are a regular computer user at the library. AskALibrarian forwarded the request to Manager VS, and Manager HR (HIM). 
Manager VS addressed the request by marking the items as ""lost"" in the patron's account. This removed the item titles from the patron's visible list of checked out items, but kept the cost of replacement added to the patron's account. 
Patron responded via email, writing, ""Much appreciated, finally getting those damn books out of my sight every time I log in to my account!""
While checking the patron's account, VS, noticed notes in the patron's record referencing borrowing issues at HIM, and the patron P Type was set to (40) Suspended. VS updated the patron's P Type to (44) Infestion req. treatment proof, and updated the message.
Manager HR contacted VS as well, forwarding her emails from one year ago, where Manager MS from Main Library had corresponded with the patron (9/11/23) about a bed bug issue in materials she had returned to Main Library. The patron replied to MS, saying: ""You are fucking crazy. All of you are. I do not have bedbugs. I think I would know if there were bugs biting me and there are not. Plus I have looked and looked for them. Found nothing. Whoever said there was a bedbug on a book I returned is a liar. I just can't figure out why. It makes no sense. I do not have the money to PAY for some kind of examination from an exterminator. So you can kindly shove your library . I don't give a fuck."" 
RECOMMENDED COURSE OF ACTION:
Document any further incidents with this patron in PITS.
If patron asks about renewing borrowing privileges, Managers are encouraged to use their judgement to decide what course of action they would like to take. Circulation Services recommends two possible courses of action, based on their assessment of the patron's needs, behavior, and situation: 
---CONSERVATIVE APPROACH: explain to the patron that they will need to bring proof of treatment before we can allow them to check out books again.
---2ND CHANCE APPROACH: If you think there has been a situational or personal change that may have caused the patron to no longer have a bed bug issue, for example, a change of address that they have shown proof for, then branch managers are welcome to talk to the patron about this. it's important to note that 1) bed bugs can move with a person to a new address 2) the patron still owes money to the library that they will also have to resolve through payment or replacement, before they can use their account again. 3) reinstating this patron's privileges is risky, given their borrowing history, and may result in further loss of library materials, and a reinstatement of suspended borrowing privileges. Staff will need to carefully monitor her returns.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0034",1,2024-08-08,0-01-01 18:00:00,"18:00:00","06:00:00 PM","Administration - 4th Floor",0-01-01 18:00:00,"18:00-18:59"

SM explained that, though we would like him to stay at the library, he must abide by our Code of Conduct and staff requests. Further, since this was the 2nd time he was asked this today, we would ask him to leave for the day if he had to be reminded a 3rd time.

Patron 1 was swearing loudly at one of our regular patrons, Michael. LTAS SS approached to try and de-escalate the situation, and Michael had left the area in the seconds LTAS SS was approaching. LTAS SS heard out Patron 1's side of the story, not having seen it personally- Patron 1 had approached Michael, who was on a speakerphone call and was speaking loudly as well as using expletives in his speech while in a quiet study area, to tell him to be quiet and not use that kind of language in the library. After Michael was done with his phone call, he had approached Patron 1 and was angry. Patron 1 and Michael ended up briefly arguing with each other, ending in Patron 1 telling Michael to ""fuck off"" among other things. The surrounding patrons all chimed in to corroborate this version of events, though one was upset about how Patron 1 acted in this situation. LTAS SS, after hearing him out, reminded Patron 1 that regardless of the circumstances, yelling at others was unacceptable behavior in the library, and to please get a staff member to address issues with other patrons in the future. He seemed very apologetic, embarrassed, and seemed to understand what LTAS SS was telling him while assuring them that it wouldn't happen again, so LTAS SS moved on to speak to Michael and get his side of events.
LTAS SS spoke with Michael, who told them his version of events. He reported that Patron 1 had told him to be quiet and to not use bad language because this was a library, and that he had approached the patron afterwards to confront him about the perceived rude behavior. He said that he understood that he was also in the wrong, and had realized his phone call was disruptive to others. He was insistent that he was not the only party in the wrong, and also that he did not want to be kicked out over this. LTAS SS reminded him to not engage with other patrons, and to please come get staff if something should arise, as well as that if he needed to call people he could always take his calls outside or down the hall, away from the quiet area. While LTAS SS was talking to Michael, multiple patrons come up to the desk to report the verbal altercation between Patron 1 and Michael and also that Michael was not being truthful, so LIII KS entered the conversation and reminded Michael that rather than approaching other patrons himself, to get staff to help handle the situation. She also reminded him that we have heard him on the phone before and that we have had heard him using curse words on phone calls before. He assured LIII KS and LTAS SS that going forward he wouldn't take calls in the library anymore, though we did remind him he had other options in regards to taking calls in the library and didn't have to stop entirely. He appeared understanding of what we had told him.

The quiet one, because she’s so quiet.” NM clarified that she had greeted him with a hello when he first entered the building, but he had not heard her. The patron then told NM, “Well don’t sue me, I don’t have a penny to my name. I just make nicknames for people,” and returned to his chair.

As the next reservation was approaching, Librarian I MM located Ms Flowers and requested that she remove her belongings so that others could use the room. Ms Flowers indicated that she could not transport her items by herself. As a one-time courtesy, and to speed the process and allow access to the study room for other patrons, L1 MM offered her the use of a library cart and escorted her and the cart out to her vehicle.
This has now turned into Ms Flowers believing she is entitled to use library carts whenever she wishes. On 8/27 Ms Flowers was spotted grabbing an unattended cart (the page had left it briefly after finishing shelving, while gathering items for cleanup) and using it to store her belongings on. Staff were unable to address this with her at the time as the library was very busy.
Today Ms Flowers returned and was using the ADA computer. When she was finished (approx. 1:35pm), she casually mentioned, ""And I'm going to need the cart"" to Librarian II AD and then walked away, back to her computer, apparently expecting LII AD to follow with a cart. LII AD then became busy making several library cards and at approx. 1:50pm LA GL, who was unaware of the escalating issue but aware of L1 MM's one-time courtesy, allowed her to use a cart to transport her belongings to the car. Ms Flowers told LA GL that she would return promptly.
Approx. 2:10pm, it became apparent that this was not the case. Ms Flowers was now ensconced in the quiet area, preparing to use an armchair with the library cart filled with her belongings next to her. She showed no indication that she was removing her belongings from the cart or otherwise interested in returning the cart. LII AD approached and waited for her to sit in the armchair, then indicated the cart and said ""Excuse me, but we need that back."" Ms Flowers appeared perturbed and muttered, ""No one ever told me that before."" LII AD said ""The carts are really for staff use. We can't let you have a cart unattended."" At this point Ms Flowers cut LII AD off and snapped, ""All you had to say was you needed it back!"" She again made no move to remove any of her belongings from the cart. LII AD said ""Okay, so if you can clear the cart off, I'll take it with me."" Ms Flowers angrily said ""You're going to have to wait. I'm slow and I have a bad back."" LII AD nodded their assent and walked away. To LII AD's retreating back, Ms Flowers snapped, ""I'll bring it to the front, if it means so much to you!"" LII AD did not respond and continued walking. After about 5 minutes, Ms Flowers returned the empty cart to the front desk.
Documenting because Ms Flowers did not appear to listen to LII AD's explanation of the larger issue (she cannot have library carts for extended periods or without staff present) and because these issues have escalated over the last week. Staff will explain again if she requests use of a library cart again.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0047",0,2024-08-28,0-01-01 14:10:00,"14:10:00","02:10:00 PM","Miller-Golf Links",0-01-01 14:00:00,"14:00-14:59"

The book, an anime-style graphic novel, was labeled as part of the adult section, where such materials are interfiled alphabetically within the adult-fiction collection. The customer (who was respectful throughout the transaction) expressed his support for information freedom, but he was concerned about the explicit content in the book. Specifically, he pointed out an indisputable sex scene in the book, presented via images and dialogue; also, the book is marked ""M for Mature"" on the back cover; the customer referenced ARS 34-502 during the discussion. L2 JM responded by reiterating key points from supervisor training and the Library Code of Conduct, emphasizing that parents are the primary gatekeepers for the materials their children access. L2 JM also mentioned that librarians are always available to determine the age level of any item. The customer mentioned that his daughter was disturbed by the content, and L2 JM expressed sympathy and acknowledged the impactful nature of the situation. While the customer was not advocating for the removal of the item, he suggested that adult graphic novels be separated to prevent similar issues in the future. L2 JM assured the customer he would pass along the suggestion to ABB’s L3 for a dedicated section for such materials with signage that reflects its classification. The conversation concluded, with the customer seemingly satisfied that his concerns would be communicated to the appropriate party.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0115",0,2024-08-28,0-01-01 16:00:00,"16:00:00","04:00:00 PM","Wheeler Taft Abbett",0-01-01 16:00:00,"16:00-16:59"

After declining to go to several library locations offered to her, she began to vent about the neighborhood she lives in and that it was dangerous due to the repeated break in attempts. She then asked for LTA VN’s opinion on the amount of homelessness in recent years. This continued for 10 minutes as VN tried to redirect the call back to the patron’s original question regarding computer help. The patron then became irate and started to complain about the drug use in Tucson and how much better California is and that the people in Tucson are too afraid to speak up and that LTA VN too was like that. She continued to demand VN's opinion on the subject and would get more upset each time LTA VN tried to remind her that the conversation was not appropriate. VN then stated that she could get the patron someone else to speak to. The patron took great offence to this and started to rant about people in Tucson staying silent once again.

A regular teen patron approached at the same time and said ""Can you please make this guy move?""
KVN followed the teens back to the 2 PCs in the back where Daryl was sitting on one of the PCs next to a backpack with the teen's belongings. Daryl reported that the PC said ""Available"" and no one was there so he signed in. The teens argued their belongings were right there and one was signed in and sitting there. They indicated they had tried to communicate that one of the teens simply got up, and he would not listen. 
KVN asked Daryl if he would be willing to move since he had just signed into the PC and hadn't started any work, and their items were there first, since the teen patrons wanted to sit together and there was no more room in the row. Daryl refused, repeating that no one was sitting there and it said ""Available."" He said the teens were ""being dicks."" KVN told him ""that language is not appropriate inside the library.""
So KVN told the teens that he was not willing the move and asked if they would be willing to move if she found two PCs next to each other for them. They both agreed.
KVN found two PCs next to each other and told them to come over.
Just as the one teen signed out of his PC and they gathered their items, Daryl signed out of his PC and moved over to the PC KVN had directed for the teens.
KVN asked if Daryl was moving instead and he said ""Yeah, I just didn't see there were other PCs available."" Plenty of other PCs were visibly available. 
KVN considered the situation resolved and moved to help another patron in the PC area.
She heard a commotion behind her and saw Daryl back at the PCs with the two teens, and the conversations looked tense. Daryl saw her looking and returned to his PC.
KVN asked the teens if they were okay and why he was talking to them again (as it had been resolved), and they reported he was ""being an asshole"" to them. 
KVN ignored the language and got LA NG and LTA Sup AP as backup (no guard available). 
She approached Daryl at his PC and told him that the situation had been resolved, but he went back to argue with the teens which was inappropriate, and she needed him to leave for the day. 
Daryl began arguing, calling the teens ""dicks,"" stating that he had gone over to ""log out of his PC."" He claimed KVN must be new and demanded her name over and over (KVN wears a name badge). Daryl refused to leave the library and wanted to argue and complain further. KVN said that they had already resolved the issue, and that he could call library administration if he had further concerns, but he needed to leave. Daryl slammed down his mouse and motioned for her to meet him at the front desk, where he continued to try to argue.
KVN repeated that they had already discussed everything and he needed to leave for the day. KVN wrote down the number for library administration for Daryl. Daryl stated again ""you must be new."" KVN said she was not. Daryl demanded KVN write down her name, which she refused because it was visible on her badge and she had verbally told him her name repeatedly. She told him she was the assistant manager and he could relay that to them.

Staff have been unable to catch him in the act, but circumstantial evidence has piled up (suspiciously yellow cups of fluid, bottles of yellow fluid having more in them throughout the day despite Mr Montes not leaving the library, urine spills on the carpet near where he usually sits, and the like). Today at opening, Librarian III AL and Librarian II AD approached Mr Montes on the breezeway and asked to have a conversation with him. LIII AL told Mr Montes that we had observed this behavior and needed to ask him to stop. Mr Montes readily admitted the behavior, but maintained that it was due to a medical condition he could not control, and that he had rights under the ADA. Further details of this conversation (including Mr Montes's medical history) were documented securely but not listed here due to medical privacy concerns.
LIII AL and LII AD then consulted with LSM VL, who indicated that there was no acceptable reason to allow someone to urinate in the library. LIII AL and LII AD then researched the legalities surrounding this concern as Mr Montes has a history of becoming litigious if asked to correct behavior. Together they discovered ARS 36-601 (subsection 5) and Tucson City Code 11-54 and printed these documents in preparation for a second conversation with Mr Montes. ARS 36-601 covers storing waste matter in an unsanitary manner (the bottles/cups of fluid) and TCC 11-54 prohibits public urination.
Approx. 11:30am, LIII AL and LII AD approached Mr Montes again. LIII AL let Mr Montes know that she had consulted her supervisor, LSM VL, and had been told that this behavior was unacceptable, and it was also illegal. She let him know that if we observed the behavior again, we would have to ask him to leave for the day. As expected, Mr Montes immediately demanded to know which laws he had contravened, and LIII AL gave him the City Code printout. He then asked if he had contravened city or state laws, and LII AD clarified that it was both. He then asked if federal law would trump state law, and again cited the ADA. LIII AL informed him that the ADA does not cover this and that he was not allowed to continue this behavior as it was a biohazard. He asked several times ""Who's it going to hurt?"" how it could possibly be unsafe, and LIII AL again repeated that it was a biohazard and he would be asked to leave if we observed it again. He demanded an email address to which he could send information in support of his claims under the ADA and was given the Golf Links Reference email.

Both patrons entered into a loud verbal altercation, with the female patron repeatedly refusing to hand over his one-page document. It should be noted that his document was on letter-sized paper and all of her print jobs were on ledger-sized paper. 
When KVN and KB arrived at the front desk, the male patron was explaining that she had repeatedly refused to hand over his print job for no reason. He did have the print job at this point. A separate female patron approached the desk and said that the older female patron was being ""extremely rude"" and reported she had been that way ""all day.""
KVN had observed the female patron throwing her items around the copier and cursing while the paramedics were in the building.
KVN asked Guard JD to help her ask the older female patron to leave for the day.

LII AD let her know that we could only accept 10 items at a time, but promised to have someone meet her ""at the back"", and pointed towards the employee entrance. LII AD asked the woman what vehicle she was driving for identification purposes and the woman could not provide either, saying only that her car was blue. LII AD asked Librarian SM to meet the woman by the employee entrance. L SM attempted to locate the woman by the employee entrance four separate times, but was unsuccessful.
Approx. 2:35pm, the woman returned, very agitated. She said that no one had been out to help her and that she'd been waiting for ""at least 15 minutes!"" The library was very short staffed and there were only 3 employees available and on the clock to cover 3 service points, so LII AD explained that they would attempt to have someone help her again, and asked her to return to her vehicle. Library Associate WB overheard this and volunteered to step away from the service desk to assist her. When she saw LA WB enter the back room, she demanded to be allowed to follow him. LII AD let her know that only employees were permitted in the employee area, and that she would need to meet LA WB outside. She protested, saying she'd already tried that and it hadn't worked. LII AD repeated that LA WB would be meeting her and ended the conversation, helping another patron who had been waiting.
When LA WB located her outside (in the handicapped spots near the front entrance, nowhere near the employee entrance she'd been directed to), she was still agitated and becoming increasingly hostile. She complained that ""She wouldn't let me in!"" (referring to LII AD). LA WB reiterated that only employees were allowed in the employee area, and also explained that the library could take a maximum of 10 donated books per day. As a compromise, he offered to take one of her boxes (approximately 15 books), but not the rest of the items. She snapped, ""It's almost like you don't want these books!"" LA WB indicated that he had offered all he could and asked if she still wanted his help to take one box. She said ""I don't know, do you want to help me?!"" At this point, LA WB chose to discontinue the interaction due to the woman's increasing hostility and aggressiveness. He reported that as he walked away, she was still clearly upset and angry.

During the interaction with Librarian TM, manager IR, who was also at the front desk heard the male library user say to TM ""I have had the biggest crush on you since I used to go to storytime. You're just so beautiful."" and proceeded to continue with his romantic advances. TM did not accept or respond to the verbal advances, and handed him the information that he needed and explained how he could get online with his laptop. Once the library user took the information, he started again with his verbal advances. Manager IR, who was working on something with staff at the adjacent desk, turned to the patron and said ""Let me stop you right there. This is not appropriate conversation with the librarian. You need to stop talking like this to her, this is her place of work and it is inappropriate."" 
The library user argued when he was redirected to stop making those comments, but walked away grumbling to the computers. He muttered under his breath a derogatory word to IR. And sat down.
Prior to this interaction, TM had walked to the back room to let in-charge staff know that this patron was in the building and that she was uncomfortable talking to him because he had made inappropriate comments towards her in the past, which made her feel ill-at-ease. Additionally, on today's visit, the man had been glaring in her direction since he had seen her at the desk, which she was posted at for the 10am-11am hour.
Once he got settled at the computer and logged in, TM went to work in the back room and IR stayed to cover the front desk. The library user who sat facing his computer turned sideways periodically to glare in the direction of the front desk, and grumbled to himself on two additional occasions when IR walked past him to help another patron.
Staff covering the desk the following hour (LSMs KZ and PAC) reported that the same man approached the front desk again, with an uneven gait and rambling conversation that was consistent with being intoxicated, as well as made staff and patrons feel ill-at-ease. 
Library user was asked to leave for the day. He complied, but returned a couple of hours later.

Pamela was reporting that a ""male with one-leg who uses crutches"" was inside the library and had just called her demanding money. She told AP that he ""has a knife and uses drugs"" and told AP to look for him and call the police if he was in the library because he has ""warrants out for his arrest."" 
AP let the patron know that we cannot identify anyone who is in the library. The patron started becoming more upset, started cussing, and told AP ""then him stabbing everyone in the library is on you then.""
AP grabbed L2 KVN to take over the phone call.
L2 KVN introduced herself and asked for more details. 
KVN found out that Pamela Pope is the mother (or MIL) to this male patron she is reporting, and that she has this male patron's 14-year-old son (her grandson). She is claiming this male patron uses ""meth, heroin, and fentanyl."" She stated that he had harassed her at Village Inn earlier in the day, she called TPD, and he left before TPD arrived. She repeated to KVN that he has ""8 warrants out for his arrest"" and he ""carries a steak knife in his backpack.""
KVN asked if he had threatened her, and she said no. She said he had been asking her for money calling from the library's phone. She claimed he had just been released from Palo Verde Mental Hospital.
KVN apologized that Pamela was experiencing such a difficult time and validated her feelings. KVN reiterated what AP had told her, that there was no way for them to identify to her (Pamela) if this male patron was currently in the library. Pamela kept repeating that she did not want to come to the library and ""bring her 14-year-old grandson to watch his father get arrested."" KVN encouraged her to stay away if she was worried as there was no reason for her to come see if he was in the library. KVN suggested that Pamela call to make the report and Pamela refused and started cussing and making threats about the behavior this male patron might display in the library. 
KVN let her know that if this male patron displayed threatening behavior, showing signs of being under-the-influence, or used drugs in the library then the police would be called. 
Pamela became more agitated and started cussing again, telling KVN ""he's going to fucking smoke fentanyl in your bathrooms and you don't give a fuck."" 
KVN assured her it was against library policy and the proper authorities would be called at that point. 
Pamela continued to cuss and say that she didn't want him calling her. KVN encouraged Pamela again to call the police and make a report because they can do the investigation for her. 
Pamela ended the phone call by saying ""Fuck you, call the police goddammit.""

As he was doing so, he noticed two people on the phone simultaneously, near the bushes just South of the library sign. Because this is a common place for patrons to make phone calls or smoke, he thought nothing of it.
About 7 minutes later, at 1:37PM, a firetruck and ambulance entered the library parking lot and responded to an emergency call, presumably from the two aforementioned individuals. LA NG identified one of the callers as a St. Joseph's Hospital/Carondelet Medical Center security guard in a black uniform, along with an unidentified woman. There was a presumably unconscious individual lying face down beneath one of the bushes South of the library sign. Paramedics/firemen turned him over and moved him by his arms and legs to the paved drainage channel by an open parking space nearby. 
At this point LA NG entered the building and brought the situation to the attention of LII KVN. LII KVN and LA NG exited the building and monitored the situation from the front entranceway. Paramedics appeared to be applying some kind of paste/lotion and attaching a defibrillator or similar medical device to the bare chest of the unconscious individual. While LIII KVN and LA NG were observing the emergency response, the two noticed and acknowledged that suspended patron Sean #2 entered the library.
LII KVN and LA NG approached the paramedics/firemen and asked them if it would be an appropriate time to ask a problematic patron to leave due to the potential for interference with the apparent medical intervention. The paramedics expressed confusion and directed LII KVN to contact TPD if she had any need of assistance with the patron. LII KVN reiterated that they did not need any help with asking the patron to leave, and that she simply wanted to avoid any sort of interference in the ongoing emergency response. The paramedics stated that the situation was under control and reiterated that TPD would need to be called if any sort of altercation began within the library.
LII KVN and LA NG returned to the library, where LII KVN proceeded with asking Sean #2 to leave the library (See incident #0000023849). LA NG returned to the staff area in order to punch-in from his lunch hour, and continued to monitor the emergency response from the front porch after Sean #2 had left library property. Paramedics had been joined at this point by a younger individual, who seemed connected in some way to the unconscious individual as well as the woman who had been on the phone. Paramedics placed the unconscious individual, sitting-up, onto a gurney, and continued to examine his condition while shining a flashlight in both of his eyes.

Before he had a chance to continue telling him about the recent 3rd floor changes (no seating, just browsing area with a few tables, and 3rd floor desk not staffed) Thomas became visibly upset and immediately began asking loudly for ""Amber."". LIC LII JM immediately headed over to try and explain to the patron and both she and the guard to attempted to calm the patron down. Thomas Wegner asked LIC LII JM ""is Amber here?"" and ""Are you Amber?"" referring to the director of the library. LIC LII JM told Thomas that she was not sure if Amber was in the building right now, but that she (JM) could speak with him about the issue he was having with new 3rd floor changes. LIC LII JM tried to explain to the patron that the Main Library doesn't have enough staff to have someone at the reference desk on 3rd and so the seating had been removed but that he was welcome to browse the collection of books on 3rd. Thomas stated ""you're short staffed? I think you have too much staff"" and he continued to say loudly that every time he's in the library down on the 1st floor, the circulation staff behind the desk isn't doing anything and that he can never check out the magazines he wants to because the stickers need to be changed, and he called the circulation staff ""useless"". The patron said that he thinks that we actually need less staff at the library. He stated that staff on the 1st floor shouldn't just be standing behind the desk ""doing nothing,"" but that instead staff should be going out doing other work on the floor. LII IC JM waited for the patron to finish speaking for a moment and then she explained to him that if he ever see's staff standing behind the desk and it doesn't appear that they are doing anything, they are simply waiting for patrons to come up and ask for assistance. She also tried to explain that staff need a break from time to time because it gets very busy at the 1st floor desk and they are constantly being called back to the desk when they try to do other things. She reiterated that they are often very busy with too little staff. The patron just kept repeating ""this is ridiculous,"" and he began to walk towards the elevator to go downstairs. A woman with a child in a stroller came up the stairs to 3rd floor and Thomas then began speaking loudly in their direction about how staff is being ridiculous, and ""can you believe, they're not even allowing patrons to look for a book."" LIC LII JM approached the patron with the stroller who was trying to walk past Thomas and asked if there was anything she could help them to find and explain that this is now just a browsing area, no seats or staff at desk and Patron Thomas Wegner said ""Oh, well why is SHE able to get a book?"" The Patron then said that he just wanted to get a book, at which point LIC LII JM and LII PP who was also on the 3rd floor at that time told Thomas again that ""you are welcome to browse!"" The patron seemed to start to understand, and he went back into the 3rd floor to browse the collection. There were no further incidents reported during the day with this patron and he left the library after checking out at the 1st floor desk.

BA and the patron walk over to the printer to receive the print job when regular Margaret walks up to the printer. BA tries to grab the print job he sent before Margaret can print hers so there is no confusion about whose print jobs were whose. Margaret had yet to pay for the print job when she saw the paper's printing and became very upset at BA for ""Taking her prints"". BA explained that these papers actually belonged to another patron and that Margaret still needed to pay for her print job before they would be released. this agitated Margret as she insisted they were hers. BA then explained again how these belong to another patron. this is when Marget starts to yell at BA for being rude to her. BA shows Margaret the print jobs are not hers and walks away with the patron he was helping earlier. At this point, Margaret walks up to the police officer on duty to report BA and demands he does something. Officer M walks up to BA, VV, and MD at the desk to ask about the situation. Officer M also witnessed the interaction and confirmed that none of BA's actions could be considered rude or warrant the reaction Margaret displayed. Officer M walks back to Margaret to attempt to de-escalate her without triggering her more as she has a history of assuming staff are targeting her personally. Margaret decided to finish her work and leave. 
BA is now helping another patron at Printer #1 when Margaret walks up to the printer station. The patron BA is helping and has some of his papers on the table next to the printer with some on top of the staple remover. Margaret then tried to move the papers that belonged to the other patron when the patron said ""Those are my papers"" Margaret was then upset and told them to hurry as ""people are allowed to sit at the desk"" Margaret then walked up to the desk demanding a stapler and a staple remover. VV explained there was a staple remover at the table next to the printer. Marget then accused BA of not letting her use the staple remover and she would like another one. VV explained that due to the size of the staple remover, they tend to go missing thus why there is one tied to the table that she is more than welcome to use and that BA was only using the printer, not the table. insistent that BA is not allowing her to use the table at all and demands a staple remover. VV gives her a spare one and she walks off with both the stapler and remover.
When done with her work she returns to the desk and slams the stapler and remover in front of MD and demands BA's business card so that she can complain to his boss.

When KVN went to investigate, there was a small dog wandering around patrons and sniffing the floor, not in control of it's owner. A female patron standing at copier 2 quickly called the dog over. 
The dog then started approaching KVN, so KVN said ""Hi, baby"" and bent down slightly. The dog immediately showed it's teeth and started growling.
KVN informed the patron that because the dog is not following the ""code of conduct"" expected of service dogs, the dog needed to leave.
The woman asked ""what do you mean, she's a service dog.""
KVN did not argue, but said ""The dog was seen wandering around the PC area and just growled at me, and service dogs are required to be in the owner's control and to not show sign's of aggression in the libraries"" so KVN once again asked the dog to leave.
The woman argued that KVN was not allowed to ask her to leave because it was a service dog, but KVN repeated the rules and the request.
The patron picked up her dog. KVN helped the woman finish printing and waited over 3 minutes for the woman to collect her items. The woman sat back down at the PC, pulled a drink out of her bag, and began browsing her email.
KVN walked over to the PC and said ""I have asked you to leave, so I need you to start packing up.""
The patron began accusing KVN of ""harassment"" and raised her voice claiming she ""was packing up her stuff"" and she just needed to ""give her a minute."" She repeatedly told KVN to ""back off."" 
KVN said ""okay"" and backed away to the center table for the computer monitor. 
The patron because cussing out loud and ""harassment"" and swore about KVN.
KVN was also monitoring the other incident happening in the middle of the PC area. L1 LB grabbed KVN because L3 KK was on the phone about the other incident. KVN asked LB to monitor the patron with the dog.

She walked to the service desk and demanded from LTA KB ""the name of the crazy lady right there"" and pointed at KVN. KVN told the patron ""you have been asked multiple times to leave, you need to leave now."" 
The woman demanded KVN's name and position so she could ""call City Council,"" which KVN provided. KVN attempted to provide information for administration, but the patron insisted City Council would handle the situation. 
The woman left and a few minutes later returned without her dog, claiming ""only [her] dog was suspended. L3 KK went to handle the situation.
The patron told L3 KK that KVN had ""stood over her"" and been ""harassing"" her. She claimed the library did not have the right to remove a service dog and that no one should approach a service dog. KK told the patron that in a public space anyone could approach a service dog, and a dog that growls and shows it's teeth is a safety concern.

The man quickly got up and made motions to leave but then turned around and came within inches of MNC's face, clenching his fists and drawing back one of his arms like he was about to swing. Seeing this, Guard CS swiftly reacted and came between MNC and the man, allowing MNC to back away. 
Guard CS was able to start moving the man towards the door. The man then began shouting that he would make MNC regret this and that he would get the cartel to come and kill him.

At that time I told Jackson that striking his sibling was unacceptable (particularly when a friend sitting with Jackson tried to argue it was his brother so it didn't matter) and I told Jackson that he needed to leave for the day. I walked him to the exit and told him that I would see him tomorrow. Jackson circled around the building immediately to stare through the window at his siblings and again I motioned that he had to leave.
Two of Jackson's friends went to another librarian on desk, John, and told them that Jackson was overheated outside. John did not know the details about the reason for Jackson being asked to leave for the day but didn't want Jackson to suffer from overheating so told called Jackson's mother and discussed how Jackson could come back into the A/C and get a drink to cool down as long as he wasn't hanging out in the children's area again.
Jackson did not listen to this restriction and came back into the children's area where I saw him again. I asked him why he was back in the children's room and he said another librarian let him in. I told him that maybe that was a mistake and motioned for him to come with me to talk to John again about what was going on.
John explained he hadn't know the detail about the suspension for the day but wanted Jackson to have a chance to cool off and asked if there was any way we could work together to accomplish that. I agreed with John that Jackson could stay in the library as long as he stayed in the gray chairs over by the teens.
Jackson did not go to the gray chairs but immediately went outside to the bench again. I followed and reiterated that he is welcome to be inside the A/C on the gray chairs or if he was feeling better he could stay on the bench but that he could not keep coming back in and out of the library after he had been asked to leave for the day. Jackson did not verbally respond to being told this. I said that by not talking I had to assume that he was okay to stay on the bench until he was picked up and that he was welcome back tomorrow.
I returned to my program and after a few minutes I again saw Jackson inside; I believe that his siblings also reported that Jackson had come back inside without permission. I approached Jackson and told him that for continuing to come back into the children's area after being told to leave this was going to have to escalate to being suspended from the library for two weeks. He did not answer me but he told his siblings that he did not care.
I went back to the office to write up the suspension letter and brought it to Sam's attention at the desk that I was going to deliver this suspension letter and to double-check that the escalation wasn't beyond what we have done for other patrons. Sam agreed with the suspension and we took it over to the children's area to deliver to Jackson. Jackson refused to take the letter, refused to directly acknowledge Sam or I and continued to only talk to his siblings who were by the computers who were both asking Jackson to just take the suspension and leave.
After refusing to take the two week suspension and refusing to leave, Sam told me that the refusal to listen to staff and now trespassing in the library after a suspension letter we would increase the suspension to two months and that we would need to call the police to enact the suspension. Jackson said to his siblings that he ""did not care"".
I returned to the desk to make the adjustments but mentioned that it would take a moment to edit the letter and that Jackson's mother was on route to pick up her children so we may not have time to have police respond to serving the suspension letter so please keep an eye out for Mrs. Plaga.
I went to edit the letter to a two month suspension and at about the same time I finished the edits, Mrs. Plaga did show up and both Sam and I explained the situation. Mrs. Plaga was a bit confused because she had heard from John that Jackson was allowed back in the building but somewhere in communication she did not hear that he had still been asked to leave the children's area and had refused to follow that restriction. Mrs. Plaga accepted the suspension letter on her son's behave and left with her children after we explained when Jackson was allowed to return and where she could direct her concerns if she felt that the suspension was unfair.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0048",1,2024-10-25,0-01-01 15:15:00,"15:15:00","03:15:00 PM","Wheeler Taft Abbett",0-01-01 15:00:00,"15:00-15:59"

An older, adult male patron seated at adult computer station 17 made a comment to staff, stating that the kids were being too noisy and complaining about a whistling sound coming from the children’s area. The patron did not approach the circulation desk with this complaint, but was in earshot. His voice was loud and agitated. The patron then continued to use the computer. The patron was wearing a bright green baseball cap and a greenish-grey shirt. 
Staff did not interact further with the adult patron at this point. L1 EM walked to children’s computers and asked the children to lower their voices and overall noise level. A child volunteered information that they had a small whistle on their keychain and had been making noise with it earlier. EM instructed the child to put the whistle away completely and not to take it out while in the library. 
At 4:04 pm, two minutes after his initial comment, the adult male patron began shouting and using profanity directed at the children in the computer area. He yelled, “Fuck this shit. You punks. Your parents don’t teach you how to act in public, you little shit. Goddamnit!” while making eye contact with the children.
LTA EC addressed the patron briefly, “Sir, no.” EM moved to stand next to the children who were being shouted at to assure their safety and deter the adult patron from approaching or communicating with them further. The adult patron then gathered his belongings while continuing to shout and then left the building. In-charge staff AG and KN were summoned, but the patron was no longer in the building or on the property.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0146",1,2024-10-26,0-01-01 16:02:00,"16:02:00","04:02:00 PM","Flowing Wells",0-01-01 16:00:00,"16:00-16:59"

He was condescending and rude, speaking very slowly as though NG were stupid, and when NG paused for a moment to look up the answer to his question, he asked if she spoke English. NG told him she did not like the way that he was speaking to her. The patron immediately became combative and told her she was bad at her job and that he was going to report her. NG placed the patron on hold and called L2 CS for backup.
CS took over the call. The patron recounted the whole previous conversation, including the racist comment about speaking English, and demanded to know NG's identity. When CS said that she could not give him NG's information, he demanded to speak with Amber Mathewson immediately. CS offered to give him Amber's phone number, at which point he began telling CS that he wasn't going to wait because he had donated over a quarter of a million dollars to the library and Amber would speak to him when he wanted. He went on a long rant about how he would never donate to the library again, and how he would get 25 of his friends to stop donating as well, because ""they're loyal to me, not the library."" He also continued to insult NG and CS. When CS attempted to interject, he told her that he had let her talk (he had not) and he expected basic courtesy. Eventually, CS interrupted the customer and said, ""Sir, at this point you have been rude and condescending to me and to my staff. I can either give you the Library Director's phone number, or I can end this call."" The patron asked for the number, which CS gave. The patron immediately hung up on her.

(For additional context, we have had electioneers, poll watchers, and other individuals standing right outside the boundary behind or near the signs all week using them to indicate to poll workers and voters that they were not violating election rules and could continue their activities.)Guard CS attempted to break up the fight and stop the chase as Shyanna threatened to hit the two boys with the sign. Another patron tried to intervene as well and was also sworn at and threatened by Shyanna. Guard CS was able to talk Shyanna down and she left the property.L1 MNC went outside to investigate the disturbance. After speaking with CS, he attempted to speak with Keysasi and Carlos about their inappropriate behavior. He informed them that they were suspended for 1 week for their actions and directed them to leave. They initially refused, but then moved onto the sidewalk. They then continued to test boundaries by yelling that they are not on library property, then walking back into the lot or into the driveway and back to the sidewalk. MNC told them that their suspension was now 2 weeks and again directed them to leave at which point they complied.Due to her role as instigator/aggressor in the fight, removing the ""75 foot limit"" sign placed by election officials to mark the polling place boundary, threatening to use it as a weapon against other youths, and posing a danger to other patrons, Shyanna will be suspended for 1 year.
Pima County Recorder's Office staff will also be filing their own report about the incident for their documentation.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0035",1,2024-11-01,0-01-01 16:10:00,"16:10:00","04:10:00 PM","Eckstrom-Columbus",0-01-01 16:00:00,"16:00-16:59"

A long line of dog urine could be observed leading to the elevator. The woman along with her 2 dogs can be seen exiting the library at 4:53pm and coming back on to the 3rd floor at 5:01pm walking past the large urine stain without acknowledging it and back into the Tortolita Room for the event.

Due to the large number of people exiting the room and coming back in during that time, and due to the shift change at that time of the guards on the 3rd floor, staff did not know exactly which dog had made the mess by the elevator until after the woman and dogs had gone back inside the Tortolita Room.

The decision was made to not interrupt the event, but to wait until the event was over and to talk to the woman with the two dogs as they were leaving. L2 JM informed L3's LF and LD of the situation with the dog urine as they were leaving the 4th floor advisory board meeting and the decision was made to tell the woman that she could no longer bring her animals into the library. L2 JM and L3 LD waited until the event was over and the woman exited Tortolita with her two dogs, L2 JM approached the woman and asked her, ""can we speak with you about the accident your dog had outside the elevators?"" The woman immediately offered to clean it up and L3 LD told the woman that the carpet would have to be professionally cleaned. L2 JM pointed out the policy of the library that only service dogs are allowed in the library and told her that her dog had exhibited behavior not consistent with a service animal and that unfortunately the dog would not be allowed back in the library in the future.

She said he also had her house keys so she was afraid she wouldn't get into the house if she took a cab without him. I was alarmed by what she was telling me and I asked her to step outside with me so we could talk privately. I asked her if she felt safe at home and she reassured me she did. I asked her if she was allowed to spend her own money and she said she was. She said her son was just bossy but she felt safe and was able to spend her own money. While she was talking she told me several inconsistencies, like she couldn't remember if she had taken the bus or whether or not her son had her debit card. Before I talked to her privately I had planned on calling for PCSD assistance to see if they could take her home and perform a wellness check. However because she was so reassuring, and it was difficult for me to decipher what was going on, I decided not to. I walked back with her to where her son was and he reiterated they would be taking the bus. He told me they had taken the bus there but his mother had a poor memory and just couldn't remember. This is for documentation, the son is a regular here. He will be given a verbal warning for sexual harassment when he comes in next.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0069",0,2024-11-07,0-01-01 18:15:00,"18:15:00","06:15:00 PM","Nanini",0-01-01 18:00:00,"18:00-18:59"

The patron complained about the noise volume of two patrons humming loudly. KSB went to go address the issue but heard no noise and was unable to identify the patron in order to speak with them. The initial patron then came back up to the front desk at ~12:06pm asking that something be done about the issue because they have anxiety and was unable to concentrate and upset that nothing was done. KSB let the patron know they did try to address the issue but nothing was heard once they went over and that someone else would address the issue because they had to leave for lunch. LHN asked the patron to show who it was making the noise, and let them know that people are allowed to have some noise volume when in the library as long as it doesn't disturb others and that they could use a study room to help concentrate. The patron responded it's not just me who's bothered by the noise but others who were too scared to complain. The patron pointed out who it was making the noise, two patrons sitting to the side corner of the laptop bar, one presenting male and one presenting female. LHN knocked on the table in order to get the attention of the male patron who was using earbuds and quietly humming. LHN said, ""Hi, sorry to bother you but there was a complaint about your noise volume and being inside a public space we ask that you be mindful of those around you and lower it just a bit."" The patron said they weren't being loud and LHN let him know that someone came up saying that the humming was too distracting, and that we have study rooms if you'd like to use one of those so they could still use the library space but after three complaints, then you may be asked to leave. The patron nodded but did not move. LHN took that as understanding and went back to the desk.
At ~12:35pm the initial patron came up to the desk and said they're both being too loud and she's watching satanic videos now. LHN went with the patron back over to the laptop area and knocked on the desk again, this time trying to get the other patron's attention sitting at the laptop bar but not wanting to be blocked in the corner. LHN spoke to the male presenting patron again letting him know that his friends volume was too high and that we could move them both into a study room so they can listen and be a little louder without disturbing others. He got the attention of the other patron telling her someone snitched. LHN said this is not an issue about someone snitching this is because we have received another noise complaint and so you can both listen to your videos or music then we can move you to another area or a study room if you both continue to be loud, otherwise they will be asked to leave if staff have to come over again so please lower your volume. LHN turned to walk away and the initial female patron that came to the desk tried to intervene saying ""They were being too loud and psychos watching satanic videos in the library."" Security guard MG let them know that the situation was being handled. MG and LHN then spoke about the incident, MG let LHN know the patron that made the complaint was also making noise and he could hear her from the other side of the building. LHN let MG know that the complaint was from the one patron but that multiple people shook their heads agreeing the patrons spoken to were too loud. MG stayed near the area to ensure no further conflicts arose. LHN returned to the desk and the initial patron came up again about the satanic videos being played in the library and LHN told her that people can watch what they want in the library as long as there's no children around for anything inappropriate to them and that there was no noise from the area this time so they could not ask those patrons to leave. The patron then walked away upset and gathered their things from the laptop area. On the way out made a comment to MG about being an ass.

CM Grabbed VV and both staff recognized the loud patron as Margaret. VV did some rounds around the computer lab to confirm if she was talking too loud but thought her volume was at a reasonable level. Considering how Hostile Margaret can be, VV Decided it was best if she stayed at the desk for the rest of the hour in case there were more complaints from patrons about Margaret a complaint from her herself. 
at 3:25 Margaret got up and locked her computer to print and didn't return to her computer until 3:40. Margaret complained to VV that someone was hacking her computer and preventing her from working suggesting that it was staff not wanting her in the library.  VV reminded Margaret that when a computer is left alone for 10 or more minutes it will shut down for security reasons. This explanation angered Margaret claiming it was not the case since she locked the computer and nobody had access to it so that must mean someone logged in to her computer and logged it off because they didn't want her to work. VV again stated how it was how the system is set up in case someone leaves the library without logging off. still angry Margaret said, ""Forget it I'm just going to talk to your manager She will fix this for me."" as she moved to another computer. As she left VV was turning the computer back on so it would return to the login screen and Margaret kept muttering ""You people just don't want me here, someone is trying to hack my documents, You are doing a good job at showing me you don't want me here there are lots of sites that I can go instead and I will""

After waiting several minutes for the patron to complete his phone call, and after several attempts to get his attention, L2 JM said that the patron needed to end his phone call because they needed to speak with him about a suspension. The patron ended the phone call, pushed the chair back that he was sitting in and stood up from the chair rather aggressively, asking why we were bothering him. L2 JM handed the patron his paperwork and told him that he was suspended from the Murphy-Wilmot Library until September 28th. He grabbed the paper and began reading it saying that we had the wrong person and that we needed glasses and said that he keeps getting confused with another patron. Vet Sec Guard JT told him that we had photos from the Murphy-Wilmot Library cameras and that he looked the same as the person in those photos. The patron said that he wanted to see the photos and L2 JM told him that we did not have to show him the photos we were referring to, but that we knew it was him. She told him that he was being asked to leave since he was suspended and if he wanted to challenge the suspension, he could do that with the information on the suspension letter. The patron responded by telling library staff that they could ""go to hell.""
The patron then walked over to where his items were in the cafe area and sat looking at the paperwork for a few minutes. The guards and L2 JM slowly walked over and asked him again to leave. He told them once again that he keeps getting mistaken for another patron and he's sick of it.

The mother and daughter left with the daughter crying because of the interaction.
YM spoke to L2 KVN about the incident. KVN and L1 KB went to speak with the female patron in the magazine area. KVN asked if there had been an ""incident a little bit ago with a child running."" The patron said yes, she was ""frightened"" the child was going to knock her over. 
KVN told the patron if she had concerns then she needed to speak with a staff member and not address the situations herself. The patron claimed she ""didn't know that."" KVN let her know that if something like this happened again she might be suspended. The patron acted disinterested during the conversation.
This is to document the verbal warning as this patron has a history, especially regarding the behavior of children in the library.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0120",1,2024-12-04,0-01-01 16:17:00,"16:17:00","04:17:00 PM","Murphy-Wilmot",0-01-01 16:00:00,"16:00-16:59"

IC LHN: I'm not yelling, I was letting you know just in case you didn't know already, that it's one per person. Can you please-
Patron: Oh it worked. Well I know it's one per person, I can't see and grabbed more than one, I have a disability and you're discriminating against me.
IC LHN: I'm not discriminating against you and I'm glad that the pass worked after I typed in the number. I hope you have a good day.

After she almost pulled the electrical stapler out of the wall, LIB III KS said ""Hi! I noticed you don't have enough room.

KS replied ""oh, well we would like the supplies to be accessible to everyone and the table behind you is free."" She grabbed all the supplies and piled them up, again trying to pull the stapler hard to pull out the cord, KS said ""Please don't pull the stapler. It is plugged in, and you could break it. In the future, please use an available desk rather than the supply desk if you need more room."" She said something along the lines of she would just move the supplies to the other desk instead of using it herself. KS said, ""Okay. please put the supplies back when you are done. Thank you for your understanding."" The woman smirked as KS walked away, and she said ""Bitch"". 
KS went to the desk and got her card and LIB II SY to witness the conversation. She went up to the patron and told her ""I'm Kaitlyn, the manager. Here is my card.

(She had thrown her own copy way when KS walked up to speak with her the second time, and staff desk found it in the recycle bin next to the copier for her.)

Branch Manager AL had approved this meeting to last after hours, with the agreement that TPD would otherwise abide by the rest of the meeting room rules, specifically leaving the meeting room as they had found it upon their arrival. TPD were the last group to use the meeting room on 12/13.
Approx. 10am on 12/14, Librarian I VG alerted in-charge Librarian II AD to an issue in the meeting room. The community group scheduled to use the meeting room were being let in by Page RH, who noticed that a large amount of food from TPD's party had been left out overnight and was still covering several tables in the meeting room. Additionally, the door connecting the police substation to the large meeting room had been left open, creating a security issue for TPD (this door is normally accessible only via TPD badge access; library staff do not have access to this door).
LII AD, along with Library Associates WB and GL, entered the meeting room, intending to put the leftovers in the small adjacent kitchen so as to allow the community group (still waiting for access) to use the room unimpeded. Upon arrival, AD, WB, and GL determined that there was so much food that it would not fit in the large meeting room. Additionally, they also discovered that several trays of meat products had been left out overnight without refrigeration, and there were still small self-contained propane heaters resting below the trays (that appeared to have burned out), both of which constituted potential safety hazards for the public. After attempts to reach out to police through the open internal door were unsuccessful, AD, WB and GL agreed that the food should be left where it was and documented. The community group was let into the meeting room and instructed not to touch the food either.
As of 2:15pm, the metal trays and heaters were gone and the interior door was closed, but there were still several cakes/pies and a couple of large open bags of chips in the meeting room. The community group reported that someone had come in during their meeting to clean up, resulting in further disruption to the group's meeting.
LII AD reported this to Branch Manager AL. As this is a serious violation of the meeting room agreement, AL intends to follow up with our TPD contact and reiterate the meeting room rules and policies.

Starting at 3 pm shortly after arriving at the library, a group of four boys, all wearing black jeans and black hoodies, all with distinctive broccoli haircuts, were constantly engaging in disruptive behavior and interrupting other library patrons by entering study rooms uninvited and interrupting and harassing them, speaking very loudly in the stacks, and generally being a disruption wherever they went inside the library.
After being told on 4 separate occasions between 3 pm and 3:35 pm, once outside study room E, then in the far corner near adult graphic novels, then outside study room C, and also in the gaming room, the group was told by both myself and L1 EG to calm down or they would be asked to leave the premises.
The group then went outside to the main patio area. Once there they took a soda from a junior high-aged patron, threw it on the ground, and threw some ice at that patron. The young girl came inside the library to notify myself and EG what happened. The staff did not witness this behavior. Myself and EG confronted the four boys and told them they had to leave the premises for the day.

If Denise continues to harass the Library, her suspension will be extended to a year due to harassment and failure to comply with library staff directions.

They told her that a construction worker dealing with equipment by the roadside had become concerned about an ""indigent person""/ unhoused man on library property. The worker called 911, who then dispatched the paramedics. They spoke with the man, who refused help and then laid down in front of the door. As the front door was never blocked, we believe that they meant the patio door into the meeting room. The paramedics then came inside to inform SD that if the man became a problem, we could have him trespassed. 
L1 SO walked around the outside of the building and found the man lying down in the shade outside the fence by the children's patio, on the east side of the building. When asked if he was all right, the man said yes, and if he wanted to come inside, he said no. As he was simply lying down, and not causing any problems, L1 SO decided that staff would check on him periodically but otherwise leave him alone.

Each time, he has been asked to leave, been given a copy of his 10/18 suspension letter, and has left respectfully without incident. No PITS reports were made for those days. 
Today, Sean #2 entered WIL at 1:06pm. He was immediately recognized by Guard J and LTA YM at the desk. Guard J reminded him that he is suspended and that he needs to leave. Sean said he wanted to speak to the person in charge about why he was suspended. 
LTA YM reported to L2 KVN that Sean was already making comments about staff member nationalities, saying that staff members must be involved in porn, and was using a lot of profanity. 
KVN came out with his suspension letter printed and LA RG as backup. KVN read the violations on the suspension from MAI and explained when he can return. 
Sean #2 argued that there is no name or DOB printed on the suspension letter, and therefore they cannot identify it belongs to him.
KVN told him that they had a system to keep track of incidents and that this this was his suspension letter.
Sean argued again that it wasn't, asked to see the system, and said something about the library violating his rights by keeping data on him.
He then said ""you have a lot of nationalities here. How many nationalities do you have here?"" Pointing to KVN, RG, YM, and L BL at the service desk assisting with the incident or helping patrons. 
KVN told him that she could not give him access to the system and that the suspension letter was him. She explained how can appeal and asked him to leave the building.
Sean argued that he would not because the suspension letter was not his. He wanted the phone number to call to argue his case. KVN showed him the instructions to appeal his suspension at the bottom of the letter and Sean interrupted asking KVN ""how old are you even?"" KVN told him ""that is personal information that I don't answer."" Sean said ""what are you? 26? This is fucking ridiculous."" He then went back to pointing out the ""different nationalities.""
KVN told him that if he continued using profane language and speaking in that manner, his suspension would be extended. She asked if he wanted to stay to get the number to call administration and he said yes. So KVN asked him again to calm down while she found that information for him. 
Sean did not follow instructions and went back to discussing his privacy and staff nationalities. 
KVN gave him the admin phone number and asked him again to leave the building. Sean refused. KVN said that he was trespassing and that if he refused to leave she would have to call the police. He told her to call them. KVN said okay and let him know his suspension had been extended.
KVN called 911 at 1:09pm. They specifically asked if there was any property damage. 
KVN then stood at the service desk to ensure the situation did not escalate. She ignored Sean as he tried to argue and made no further verbal response to him. KVN and other staff operated as normal while Sean stood at the service desk, stared at staff members, and occasionally tried to argue, swear, or insult staff. 
At 1:19pm, Sean said ""you guys can keep this"" (referring to the suspension letter) ""because this isn't me, but I'm going to leave.""
KVN did not respond. Guard J verified Sean left property. KVN cancelled the 911 call.

AT ~1:15pm Patron went up to L LPV at the front desk, asking for staff to make copies for her. Patron put a page and coins in front of LPV. LPV informed the patron that computer monitor & LTA SE could assist and show her how to make copies. LPV asked the patron to bring her belongings, paper, and coins with her. SE met the patron at the copier, where the patron tried to give SE the paper and coins and walked away. SE said, ""Hold on, we can make the copies together."" and did not take the page or coins. The patron replied, ""I don't want to do the copies together, or want to learn how to make the copies. It's your job to help patrons by making the copies."" SE replied that, ""I am happy to go through the copy process step-by-step with you.""
SE then instructed the patron to insert the coins in the coin slot, then put the paper in the automatic document feeder at the top of the machine, which the patron did. When the patron pushed the copy button, the copier did not work. SE pressed the touch screen on the copier to set the paper type to letter size. After SE was troubleshooting to figure out why the copy machine wasn't working, the patron expressed her frustration that SE would not complete the copy job for her. She said that ""It's your job as a library worker to help patrons copy and you're not doing your job."" After choosing the paper size, the copy machine still did not copy. SE realized that the paper was not fully inserted into the automatic document feeder and pushed the paper in fully. SE asked the patron to push the blue button.
Before the patron pushed the blue button, she reiterated that, ""You should have been the one doing the copying, as library staff and you're not doing your job well."" (because the copies did not come out initially). SE responded, ""I am happy to help you make copies, but I would like you to speak to me respectfully."" The patron pressed the copy button and the copies came out. The patron asked, ""How am I speaking disrespectfully? I'm just asking you to do your job and copy the pages for me, it's not my fault that you don't know what you're doing. You don't deserve my respect."" At this point L LPV went to grab IC LHN from the back and let them know they should listen to the conversation at the desk, a patron was yelling at SE. SE handed the patron her copies and asked if she needed any additional assistance. The patron continued to ask how she was speaking disrespectfully and SE replied that they can give her a copy of the code of conduct. 
As SE gave the patron the code of conduct IC LHN stepped in. LHN said ""Hello-"" patron interrupted and said, ""Other people print for me because I'm always printing for DES, and upset because I'm not disrespectful, I asked to print, I didn't ask SE to print it for me but to do their job."" LHN let the patron know that ""We only do printing for free when it's for specific things like DES."" The patron said, ""I know, I just needed two pages, and they wouldn't help me."" LHN let the patron know that. ""It is our job to help guide people on how to use the machine, but we do not just do it for them, and to be mindful of how they speak to our staff members because they cannot get help if they are disrespectful to them."" Patron said they were not being disrespectful. LHN said, ""You were raising your voice, and you can't do that to our staff."" Patron then said, ""What when, on another day?"" LHN said, ""No we are speaking about what happened today right now, not anything else. You have your print outs, just be mindful."" Officer on duty interjected as patron said, ""I was not disrespectful, I'd never be disrespectful to my elders."" Officer JO attempted to speak to the patron but they did not respond he asked ""Hello, can you hear me?"" and then waived their hand to get the patrons attention letting them know, ""Hey you got your print jobs, this seems like it was just a big misunderstanding. It's Christmas, right?"" Patron responded, ""I don't know."" Officer JO said, ""Well you got what you needed, let's just go."" SE then said to patron as they were being walked out, ""I did not mean to make you feel unwelcomed."" Patron said, ""I'm not from here, I feel unwelcomed everywhere."" LHN said, ""You’re allowed to come here but you have to follow the rules"" Patron said, ""Can you please give this to CeCe?"" handing LHN one of the pages that the patron had printed out. LHN said, “Yes, I can.” Officer JO and Security Guard MG escorted patron half way to the entrance and patron left the library.

This would be the second incident with this patron raising their voice in the library to staff. In an incident not yet documented last week by LHN telling the patron ""You may not have known this, but you cannot play music out loud in the library."" The patron said, ""I just need to print something and then I'll be out of here."" LHN let them know, ""That's fine, we can help you with printing, but you still can't play your music, please turn it off."" LHN waited for the patron to comply and they did not so LHN paused the music using their pinky. Patron turned music back on, stood up and yelled the lyrics ""BITCH NIGGA"" LHN said ""I'm going to need you to leave if you don't turn off your music."" The patron said, ""I will as soon as I get these printed out."" Handing LHN a guest pass. LHN said ""Turn off your music and I can help you with printing."" Patron turned off music and LHN let the patron know ""You'll need to pay for your documents, it's .10¢ per page."" Patron responded that ""It's for DES, so it's free."" LHN took the guess pass and printed the documents at the front desk.

The boy namedCadenwas with a group of three junior high students being disruptive inside the library, and after a few instances where staff asked them to calm down, the group left the library and went outside to the performance patio area.

Once there the small group of 4 boys was told a few times to stop causing disruptions with other students who were also using that area. Maybe 5-10 minutes after the warnings a female junior high school student came inside to the front desk and told us thatCadenhad called her a fu**ing ni**er.

I went outside to the patio area to confront the group about who said those words, they all confirmed that Caden was indeed the person who said it, but that he had left the premises and was getting a beverage at the nearby business. Caden?s peers told us what happened and we sternly told them this was unacceptable behavior.

When Caden returned from the store EG and I told him that he needed to leave for the day and that if he said those things again he would not be welcomed back at the library. Caden and the rest of his group seemed to understand the severity of the moment. Caden left the library grounds once asked to leave.

The young student who was the target of these words (name not known) was upset but appreciated our disciplinary efforts.

The patron went back to the guard station to complain and reprimand Vet Sec guard R also asked guard R if the manager was a woman or a man. LA MA had alerted LIC LII JM of the upset patron who was acting aggressively and asked for assistance. The patron kept trying to argue with the Vet Sec guard R about the Wi-Fi issues saying that it's his fault the library Wi-Fi wasn't connecting because we ""own the whole thing."" LII JM then arrived at the guard station to speak with the patron, introduced herself as the person in charge and asked if she could help him try to connect his phone to Wi-Fi. The patron asked why LII JM would know about his issue and looked back at LA MA at the circulation desk several times over the next few minutes with an intimidating stare. The patron asked several times if LII JM was a manager there and she replied that she was and that she was here to help him with his issue if he would tell her more about it. The patron said that we as the library should know when the Wi-Fi is having issues and that we control the whole thing and so it's our fault that it isn't working. LII JM tried to explain that sometimes the Wi-Fi will just take a few minutes to log in and asked him if he would like to sit down on a bench so that she could try logging into the Wi-Fi on her personal device and see if she could help figure out the issue for him. The patron spoke very quietly the whole time and was mumbling his words so that staff had to keep asking him to repeat what he said because they couldn't hear him. For over 5 minutes JM tried to talk to the man on the bench and he kept arguing and blaming JM for the slow Wi-Fi issue. He claimed that it didn't make any sense because he never had an issue connecting at the Valencia branch. Jessica explained some reasons why we may have a hard time connecting in this building from time to time. JM explained that we do not know that the Wi-Fi is down until someone tells us about it because we do not usually need to use the public Wi-Fi. She told him that she could report it to I.T. and that they would look into it and try to fix it if there is a wide-spread issue. It became obvious that the man only wanted to argue with staff and accuse them of things beyond our control. He was then asked to take his things with him and leave the library for the day. LII JM explained to the man that he would not be allowed to be combative with staff when they were trying to help him and that he would need to leave our library for the day, but that if he left now, he could come back tomorrow if he wished. The patron said that he wasn't going to come back to this library and that he would go to Valencia because their Wi-Fi never had any issues. LII JM said that he could certainly do that, but that he needed to leave now or else he would be facing suspension. The patron said that he would take his phone and his drink but that he wanted the guard to carry out his bag for him. JM replied that she would be happy to help him outside with his bag, but he said that he wanted the guard specifically to do it. JM asked the guard if he would please carry the patron's bag outside for him so that the patron could leave and the guard complied, setting his bag outside the doors and trying to get the patron to follow him out. After arguing for another minute or so, he left the library but then he picked up his bag and came right back inside. He said that he was not going to leave now and that he needed to use the phone. JM asked whether he could use his own phone to make a phone call and he said that he was using his phone to listen to music and so no, he could not. He walked past the guard and LII JM and went to the public phone, disregarding staff. After a few more minutes he came back over and said that when he was at the phone, his cell phone connected to the network. He said that he didn't intend on leaving and stood in front of the children's area. JM said that if he wouldn't leave, he would be considered trespassing and that they would be forced to call police. He told them that they could go ahead and call, he then told JM and guard R ""fuck you."" JM dialed 911 on the in-charge phone and explained to the dispatcher that there was a patron who had been asked to leave and that he was trespassing on library property.

She wanted access to camera footage, claiming the incident took place between 10am and 11am. AM documented the call and told her the Assistant Manager would give her a call back. AM reported the patron speaking with a ""raised voice"" and being ""difficult to understand.""
When L2 KVN returned from lunch, she watched security camera footage.
Patron Nicole Hill was not parked in the library parking lot, but instead against the curb on Emergency Rd (leading to the St. Joseph's ER). Nicole claimed that her car ""conked out"" which is why she had to park there. She can be seen at 4:14pm on 1/31 driving through the library parking lot and reversing to the spot on Emergency Rd where she remained parked over night until 12:10pm on 2/1.
Ms. Hill could be seen leaving her vehicle to enter the library at around 10:28am on 2/1. She returned to her vehicle briefly at 10:42am. She then went back into the library and did not go back to her vehicle until 12:10pm, when she left for the day.
At 11:43am, a car can be seen pulling up next to the drivers side of Ms. Hill's vehicle and stopping briefly. That is the only footage KVN saw that might have led to the vandalism.
Nicole Hill called back at 2pm on 2/1, and reported being ""upset"" that no one had called her back. KVN had spent the 2pm - 3pm hour on desk + reviewing camera footage.
KVN asked for clarification on what happened. Ms. Hill stated someone had ""walked past"" her car and put a sticker saying ""Repent and Get Busy"" along with hot sauce on the drivers side of her car. She said this must have happened between 10am - 11:30am. She was calmer while on the phone with KVN and spoke at a normal volume.
KVN explained that she had reviewed the camera footage and did not see anyone walk past Ms. Hill's vehicle. Ms. Hill said she talked to the security guard and the security guard told her there are cameras all around the building and if it was a library patron the police can access that footage. KVN explained that because the drivers side of her car was facing away from the cameras, any footage would likely not provide adequate evidence to help with identifying anyone. KVN told her that she was still able to follow the processes to obtaining the records through law enforcement if she wanted to see the footage, but that no camera angle from the library would capture the drivers side of her vehicle.
Ms. Hill inquired where the ""best place to park is"" so that ""these incidents will be covered on camera."" KVN explained that the security cameras are intended to protect the library building and parking lot, and therefore the best place to park for camera protection would be in the parking lot. Ms. Hill argued that she would not have been able to park in the library parking lot over night because ""[the library] would have towed her car"" which is why she was parking on Emergency Rd.

The dog's owner immediately approached and said ""that's my dog."" KVN said ""yes, and we have told you before you cannot leave your dog tied outside and unattended.""
The owner argued that she ""cannot get him out of her truck"" after she parks (an explanation she used previously) so she has to tie him up. KVN told her that is not acceptable and she either needs to find another place to park or another way to travel and transport her dog, because she cannot leave him unattended or tied outside. The patron argued it was ""only for 5 minutes,"" and KVN responded that it was enough time for other patrons to become concerned and report to KVN at the desk asking for water for her dog.
The patron continued to try to argue so KVN explained that if she leaves her dog unattended, an aggressive dog could come by and attack her dog and she would not be present to protect him.

There were three other people in the room: Jordan (a black female), and two unidentified tweens. EG knew that Jordan had experienced bullying from Tarzan and Michael?s friend group in the past. While EG was speaking with Tarzan and Michael, Jordan looked at EG and seemed uncomfortable. EG asked if Jordan wanted the boys removed from the room, and she said they were not invited in. EG tried to get the boys to leave, and Jordan left the room. Meanwhile, the girl who had initially booked the room (Rosemary) disappeared while EG was speaking to the boys.
At around 3:40pm, EG spoke to an upset parent, Rosemary?s father, who said she had been slapped and asked to see video footage. EG explained the camera policies and told him we have been seeing increased negative behaviors from this group, though no one had reported an assault. The father asked if he could file a police report and EG told him he was welcome to do so. After he left, EG tried to learn more from the kids in the building and she was stopped by Michael?s mother, who was concerned that her son was being accused of assault. EG told she didn?t know exactly who was involved, but there had been behavioral issues with Michael?s group and Michael had been reproached for this behavior in the past. Michael then left with his mother.
EG spoke with the remaining three children, including Tarzan/Hubert, attempting LRPY-style conversations.

The source and condition of the water was undetermined. LTA AB placed an out-of-order sign on the door and a cone in front of the door.
At 4:45pm, a regular male patron opened the men's restroom, looked at the floor, and entered the restroom and locked it. Guard M saw him disregard the out-of-order sign and the cone so she knocked on the door and asked him to exit.
He exited the men's restroom and argued there was no water on the floor so he could use the restroom. She told him it did not matter, the restroom was out-of-order and he needed to use the family restrooms in the front.
The patron asked Guard M ""Are you Mexican?"" Guard M reported being surprised and answering ""yes,"" to which the patron respond ""You're all failures."" He then walked away.
L2 KVN provided the patron with a copy of the Code of Conduct and explained that because he failed to follow staff directions to not use the men's restroom, and (most important) because he made derogatory comments about the guard, he is being suspended for 1 month. The patron argued but eventually complied and left the building.
Update 2/13/25: At the end of the day on 2/8/25, Guard M reported the patron attempted to stay on property and sit on the benches in front of the building. Guard M informed him he needed to leave the property entirely. He attempted to argue with her so she walked away. He gathered his belongings and as he was leaving the property, he flipped her off.
Upon further review of this incident, this patron's suspension has been extended to a 3-month suspension.","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","ID_0120",1,2025-02-08,NA,NA,NA,"Murphy-Wilmot",NA,NA

This went on for about 10 -15 more minutes until patron Anthony tried to get the attention of Patron #2 and asked if he would ?keep it down? because he was ?trying to read.? Anthony told Patron #2 that he could check out a study room and Patron #2 began making threats toward Patron Anthony, telling him to mind his own ?fucking business? and that he would come over and kick Patron Anthony?s ass. Anthony asked Patron #2 again if he could keep it down and he disregarded the request, put on his sunglasses and began rapping louder. At this point, the argument became loud enough that it could be heard from the information desk and LIC LII JM who was engaged in a conversation with a patron at the information desk came over to see what the fighting was about. LII JM approached the desk where Patron #2 was sitting and asked what the issue was and why he was cursing. Patron #2 did not respond and kept rapping and cursing. LII JM went to find a Vet Sec Guard to assist her in case she had to ask patron #2 to leave. JM and Vet Sec Guard B approached Patron #2 and asked if he could please keep it down and stop cursing in the library and told him that fighting was not allowed in the library. Patron #2 said that he was a grown-ass adult and he could do what he wanted. Vet Sec Guard B told Patron #2 that there were children on that floor and that it wasn?t appropriate for him to be cursing loud enough for them to hear. Patron #2 said ?fuck this shit? and stated that Patron Anthony wouldn?t leave him alone and that he had come into the main library several times before and his rapping and cursing had never been a issue before. LII JM told Patron #2 that it was time for him to leave for the day and the Patron gathered his things and kept cursing as LII JM and Vet Sec Guard B said that they would give the patron some room to get his stuff together and exited the stacks area to wait for him. JM went to the Information desk to update staff in the IC phone that a patron was being asked to leave. Patron Anthony then became upset and went to the desk to report to staff that when the other patron was leaving he had flashed a knife that he had sheathed and hanging on his pants and threatened Patron Anthony. Patron Anthony told staff that he felt scared to go outside after closure because he thought the patron may hurt him. Patron Anthony is houseless and Vet Sec Guard B told him what he would need to do to file a report, but since the patron had left on his own, staff had not had to call police. After staff ensured that Patron #2 had exited the building and walked across the plaza they went to speak to Patron Anthony and get further information from him about the threat which staff did not see, but can be seen on the camera footage.

When the code of conduct was explained to her, the woman argued extensively. She demanded to speak to someone higher than the manager so Librarian, MG, provided her with the phone number for administration. MG also asked Library associate, CS, for support. CS spoke with the woman and reiterated the stance of the library and the reasons for the Code of Conduct. The woman was allowed to use the restroom and given food, water, and empathy, however, entrance with the baggage was denied. The woman left after a lengthy amount of time, somewhat appeased.

Upon scanning the patron?s library card LA CC notified the patron of two billed DVDs on his account. LA CC then explained library policy but would allow the patron to check out items today and could resolve the fines on the next visit. He let LA CC know that she had told him when he checked them out to bring this to our attention since one of the cases was already a bit damaged and the other was in perfect condition. LA CC asked which one it was, and she was more than happy to take that one off his account, but there was still one that was chewed up/damaged and that he could do a replacement or pay the fine but that today she?ll go ahead and check out for him, and he can take care of it next time. The patron?s demeanor changed and became argumentative with a raised voice disrupting other patrons, as well as staff. He began asking ?What do you want me to do? What are you going to do? The DVD was already damaged? LA CC replied with library policy. The patron repeated himself 3 times as he was unable to comprehend that he would be allowed to check items out and resolve the fines on next visit by either replacing or paying the fee. About 6:40 LTA KG noticed the patron being in an aggressive manner with LA CC, who returned to staff area to retrieve the billed items, to show the damage to the patron. LTA KG followed her and asked LA CC if she needed assistance to help deescalate the situation. LTA KG was already aware of the items billed to the patron?s account and previously discussed with staff that this would be for educational purposes to prevent further damage to library materials. When LTA KG and LA CC returned to the patron to show him the damaged cases, he became dismissive and condescending to LTA KG stating ?I?m not talking to you, I?m talking to her, since she already knows the issue.? (in a loud and disruptive tone.) LA CC further reiterated the process of billed items. He once again was raising his voice and LTA KG then informed the patron that these billed items would be waived for this one time. He replied, ?okay so you?re giving me a credit?? LTA KG then explained that it?s not a credit that the fees would be waived from his account. At this point the patron seemed irate and confused and repeated himself yet again to which staff replied, ?this is not a credit?. LTA KG then offered him the option of replacing or paying for the damaged items. He then demanded to speak to the supervisor in charge of damage items. LTA KG explained that the LTA Sup was not in, but she could contact him tomorrow. He further demanded that KG call LTA Sup FC ?NOW?. LTA KG explained that she would not do that being that she is off today. Patron then demanded to speak to another person stating that ?we were not making sense.? LTA KG located LTA Sup WZ
When LTA Sup WZ and LTA KG returned to the service desk, our on-duty officer was there. Patron?s behavior changed dramatically, in a softer mellow tone he said, ?Hi sir, I am a Veteran, and I am not understanding what these girls are telling me and for my safety I asked the officer to come inside.? Library staff did not ask assistance from officer/guard. LTA Sup WZ reiterated library policy on billed items. Patron Kevin B then stated that LTA KG had told him she was going to give him a veteran credit and LTA Sup WZ repeated the policy and let him know that there is no such thing and then waived the fines as LTA KG printed the receipt. The patron further explained ?that this was his first offense and was unaware of the damaged DVD cases, and he had just returned another DVD that was damaged into the outside book-chute.? LTA Sup WZ said that outside book chute gets processed in the morning and would address the damage then.

LIC LII JM met with Vet Sec Guard B down on the 1st floor desk because they both had recognized about 5of the tweens in the large group of about 10 kids that were suspended from the previous afternoon. Vet Sec Guard J was called down to meet them and help identify the teens who were suspended. JM and Guard J approached the group of teens with the suspension letter. JM informed the group that the teens who were present the previous afternoon and involved in the harassment of a teenaged girl were suspended from the library and needed to leave. JM and Guard J talked directly to the two teens that they could definitely identify from the suspended group, told them they were suspended and asked them to leave showing them the suspension letter. The teens denied being a part of this incident. JM told the teens that they had photos and video of them because there are cameras that caught their activity the evening before. An adult male patron who did not know the teens walked up behind their group and involved himself in the conversation by telling the teens that they should sue the library. This adult patron was asked by Vet Sec Guard J if he knew this group of kids, he said that he did not and she asked him to please ?move on? and allow them to talk to the group of boys. The man still stood with the tweens and did not move on as asked by library staff. Several of the boys asked to see the photos from the library cameras and were told that they would not be allowed to view the photos. They were again asked to leave. The teens who were not involved in the previous incident kept speaking up to argue with library staff. JM told them that the whole group would have to leave the library now. The boys then started saying that they were being falsely identified and JM told them that if they did not leave, they would be trespassing and that she would have to call the police. The tweens continued to argue and JM began to make the phone call to 911. A few of the boys rushed over to the guard station, grabbing the active PITS report binder and ran out the door onto the Plaza with it. The rest of the group followed. Guards J and B both went after the teens, stopping by the planters. JM informed the police that the group had just stolen their security binder and run out the door with it. The dispatcher could hear the loud tweens in the background arguing with the Vet Sec Guards and told JM that officers would respond as soon as they could. JM was not given an ETA.

Minutes later JM was informed that another group of teens wearing all black were rushing down the stairs to fight someone. All of these teens went outside the library onto Jacome plaza and a fight broke out among these groups. An older female teen attempted to get the guard binder from the tween boys and this older teen began brandishing knives and was seen to have brass knuckles. A group of older teen girls wearing red and black rushed out to the plaza and stood behind the older female teen wearing a bow in her hair. The library went into lockout, locked the large sliding glass doors and began to guide patrons wanting to leave out of the emergency exit. When it appeared to be calm again and all of the teens were gone from the plaza, we opened back up normally.","Yes","No","Yes","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","ID_0096",1,2025-03-05,NA,NA,NA,"Joel D.

L2 MG let the patron know that the Adult Lab was a quiet area and if we had to speak to him again he would be asked to leave for the day.
At 12:50, L2 MG once again could hear the patron. L2 MG and VetSec MM approached the patron and L2 MG let him know that he would need to leave for the day. He refused saying ?I?ll leave when I?m done with this.? L2 MG replied ?You need to leave now, you?re being asked to leave for the day.? This went on once more, and L2 MG said ?I asked you to leave for the day. Since you are not complying it is considered trespassing.

He also stated ""I should smack you"" to VetSec MM as he was exiting.
VetSec MM escorted the patron outside. When he got outside he said he had left a phone inside. VetSec MM told him he was unable to reenter the library. VetSec MM called police from her cellphone due to his refusal to leave the library area. At this point, the patron attempted to push past VetSec MM. VetSec MM told the patron ?do not touch me.? The patron then attempted to climb over the wall into the patio.
LA CR noticed VetSec MM was still engaged with the patron and went outside. She offered to look for the phone. LA CR checked where the patron was sitting, but did not find a phone. She reported this to VetSec MM and the patron then stated that the phone was in the charging station. There were no phones or other devices in the charging station.
